const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Detroit</h2>
<p>Detroit's harsh winters and humid summers create unique HVAC challenges for the city's 639,111 residents. With temperatures frequently dropping below freezing from December through March and summer highs reaching the 80s, Wayne County homeowners need robust heating and cooling systems that can handle extreme temperature swings. The cold climate demands reliable heating solutions, as furnace failures during Detroit's brutal winters can be dangerous and costly.</p>

<p>Energy costs significantly impact HVAC decisions in Detroit, with DTE Energy's electricity rate of 16.2¢/kWh being higher than the national average. This makes energy-efficient systems crucial for managing monthly utility bills. Detroit homeowners typically spend 60-70% of their energy budget on heating and cooling, making system efficiency a top priority. High-efficiency heat pumps and furnaces can reduce energy consumption by 20-40% compared to older systems, providing substantial savings over the system's 15-20 year lifespan.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Detroit Climate</h2>
<p>For Detroit's cold climate, dual-fuel heat pump systems offer the best year-round efficiency and comfort. These systems use electric heat pump technology during mild weather (above 35°F) and automatically switch to gas furnace backup during extreme cold. Recommended SEER ratings for Detroit are 16-18 for air conditioning, while heat pumps should have HSPF ratings of 9.0 or higher. Gas furnaces should achieve at least 90% AFUE efficiency, with 95%+ condensing units providing optimal savings given Detroit's long heating season. Since heating represents 65-75% of annual energy usage compared to just 15-25% for cooling, investing in high-efficiency heating equipment provides the greatest return on investment for Detroit homeowners.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Detroit</h2>
<p>Detroit residents can access significant rebates for HVAC upgrades through multiple programs. Federal tax credits provide 30% of equipment costs (up to \$2,000) for heat pumps and \$600-\$2,000 for high-efficiency furnaces and air conditioners through 2032. Michigan's energy efficiency programs offer additional rebates of \$300-800 for qualifying equipment. DTE Energy provides substantial rebates including \$400-600 for ENERGY STAR certified central air conditioners, \$600-1,000 for heat pumps, and \$100-400 for high-efficiency furnaces. DTE also offers free energy audits and additional rebates for whole-home efficiency upgrades. Income-qualified customers may access enhanced rebates through DTE's low-income weatherization programs, potentially covering 50-80% of installation costs.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Detroit</h2>
<p>Selecting a qualified HVAC contractor in Detroit requires careful vetting to ensure proper installation and reliable service. Verify contractors hold current Michigan mechanical contractor licenses and EPA refrigerant handling certifications. Look for companies with at least 10 years of local experience, strong Better Business Bureau ratings, and positive Google reviews from Detroit-area customers. Essential services include 24/7 emergency repair availability during Detroit's harsh winters, comprehensive warranties covering parts and labor for 5-10 years, and financing options to help manage installation costs. Request detailed written estimates from at least three contractors, ensuring they include Manual J load calculations to properly size equipment for your home. Avoid door-to-door sales and contractors requiring full payment upfront, as reputable companies typically request only small deposits before beginning work.</p>
