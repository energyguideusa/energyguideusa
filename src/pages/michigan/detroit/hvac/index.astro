const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Detroit</h2>
<p>Detroit's cold continental climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, with harsh winters averaging 25°F and humid summers reaching 83°F. The city's 639,111 residents in Wayne County face significant heating demands from October through April, making efficient heating systems crucial for comfort and energy savings. With DTE Energy's electricity rate at 16.2¢/kWh—slightly above the national average—Detroit homeowners must carefully consider system efficiency to manage rising utility costs.</p>

<p>The Motor City's aging housing stock, much built before modern insulation standards, requires robust HVAC systems capable of handling extreme temperature swings. Detroit residents spend approximately 60% of their energy budget on heating and cooling, making system efficiency critical. High-efficiency heat pumps and furnaces can significantly reduce energy consumption, while proper sizing and installation ensure optimal performance during Detroit's frigid winters and muggy summers.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Detroit Climate</h2>
<p>For Detroit's cold climate, dual-fuel heat pump systems paired with natural gas furnaces offer optimal efficiency and reliability. These systems use the heat pump for moderate temperatures and automatically switch to gas heating when temperatures drop below 25°F. Look for heat pumps with HSPF ratings of 9.0 or higher and SEER ratings of at least 16. High-efficiency gas furnaces with AFUE ratings of 90% or above provide reliable backup heating during Detroit's coldest months. Variable-speed systems adjust output to match demand, improving comfort while reducing energy consumption by up to 30%. Given Detroit's heating-dominated climate, investing in superior heating performance takes priority over maximum cooling efficiency, though adequate air conditioning remains essential for summer comfort and indoor air quality.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Detroit</h2>
<p>Detroit residents can access substantial rebates for HVAC upgrades through multiple programs. Federal tax credits offer up to \$2,000 for heat pumps and \$600 for high-efficiency air conditioners meeting ENERGY STAR requirements. Michigan's energy efficiency programs provide additional rebates up to \$500 for qualifying systems. DTE Energy customers receive significant rebates including \$400-800 for ENERGY STAR heat pumps, \$200-400 for high-efficiency air conditioners, and \$100-300 for smart thermostats. DTE also offers 0% financing for up to 60 months on qualifying equipment. The Michigan Saves program provides low-interest loans for energy improvements, while Detroit's Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing allows homeowners to finance upgrades through property tax assessments. Combining these incentives can reduce upfront costs by \$1,500-3,000, significantly improving payback periods for efficient systems.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Detroit</h2>
<p>Selecting a qualified HVAC contractor in Detroit requires careful vetting to ensure proper installation and service. Verify Michigan mechanical contractor licensing, Better Business Bureau ratings, and NATE (North American Technician Excellence) certifications. Experienced Detroit contractors understand local building codes, permit requirements, and climate-specific installation practices. Request detailed written estimates comparing equipment options, efficiency ratings, and warranty coverage. Quality contractors perform Manual J load calculations to properly size systems for your home's specific needs. Look for contractors offering comprehensive warranties covering both equipment and labor for at least five years. Emergency service availability during Detroit's harsh winters is crucial—choose contractors providing 24/7 support. Check references from recent customers and verify insurance coverage. Reputable contractors explain rebate programs, assist with paperwork, and provide ongoing maintenance services to protect your investment.</p>
