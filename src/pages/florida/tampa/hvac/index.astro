const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Tampa</h2>
<p>Tampa's hot-humid climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, with temperatures regularly exceeding 90°F and humidity levels often above 70% during summer months. The city's 384,959 residents in Hillsborough County rely heavily on air conditioning from March through November, making efficient cooling systems essential for comfort and energy savings. Tampa's subtropical climate means HVAC systems must handle both intense heat and moisture removal, requiring robust dehumidification capabilities alongside cooling power.</p>

<p>With Tampa Electric providing power at 11.8¢/kWh, energy costs can quickly escalate during peak cooling months when systems run nearly continuously. A typical Tampa home spends \$1,800-2,400 annually on cooling costs alone, making energy-efficient HVAC systems crucial for managing utility bills. The combination of extended cooling seasons and moderate electricity rates means that investing in high-efficiency systems can provide substantial long-term savings while ensuring reliable comfort in Tampa's demanding climate.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Tampa Climate</h2>
<p>For Tampa's hot-humid climate, HVAC systems should prioritize both cooling efficiency and dehumidification. The minimum recommended SEER rating is 16, but 18-20 SEER systems provide optimal performance and energy savings given Tampa's extended cooling season. Heat pumps are particularly effective in Tampa, as they can handle the minimal heating needs (only 10-15 days below 60°F annually) while providing exceptional cooling efficiency. Variable-speed systems excel in Tampa's climate by maintaining consistent temperature and humidity control while consuming less energy during moderate weather periods. Since cooling accounts for 85% of HVAC usage in Tampa compared to just 15% for heating, investing in premium cooling technology delivers the best return on investment.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Tampa</h2>
<p>Tampa residents can access multiple rebate programs to offset HVAC upgrade costs. Federal tax credits provide up to \$2,000 for qualifying heat pumps and up to \$600 for central air conditioners meeting efficiency requirements through 2032. Florida offers no state income tax, but property tax exemptions are available for renewable energy systems. Tampa Electric provides rebates up to \$1,600 for qualifying ENERGY STAR heat pumps and up to \$800 for high-efficiency central air conditioners with SEER ratings of 16 or higher. Additional rebates of \$50-150 are available for programmable and smart thermostats. The utility also offers financing programs with favorable terms for energy-efficient upgrades, making high-performance systems more accessible to homeowners throughout Hillsborough County.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Tampa</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in Tampa requires verifying proper Florida state licensing and local Hillsborough County permits. Look for contractors with extensive experience in Tampa's climate who understand humidity control and can properly size systems for the hot-humid conditions. Top contractors should offer comprehensive warranties (10+ years on equipment, 2+ years on labor), provide detailed load calculations, and have strong Better Business Bureau ratings with local references. Emergency service availability is crucial in Tampa's climate where AC failures during summer can be dangerous. Ensure contractors are familiar with Tampa Electric's rebate programs and can help maximize available incentives. Request multiple quotes and verify insurance coverage, as quality installation is essential for system performance and longevity in Tampa's demanding environment.</p>
