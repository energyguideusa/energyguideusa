const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Fort Lauderdale</h2>
<p>Fort Lauderdale's hot-humid climate provides excellent conditions for solar energy production, with an average of 248 sunny days per year. The city's 182,760 residents can significantly benefit from solar installations due to Florida Power & Light's (FPL) electricity rate of 12.3¢/kWh, which is above the national average. The intense Florida sun, combined with year-round solar exposure, makes Fort Lauderdale an ideal location for maximizing solar panel efficiency and energy savings.</p>

<p>The hot-humid climate in Broward County means air conditioning costs drive up electricity bills, especially during summer months when temperatures regularly exceed 85°F. Solar panels perform well in Fort Lauderdale's climate, though the high humidity and occasional severe weather require proper installation and quality equipment. With FPL's net metering program, homeowners can sell excess energy back to the grid, making solar installations even more financially attractive for Fort Lauderdale residents looking to reduce their dependence on traditional electricity sources.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Fort Lauderdale</h2>
<p>Fort Lauderdale residents can take advantage of several solar incentives to reduce installation costs. The federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit on the total system cost through 2032, then decreases to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Florida offers additional benefits including no state income tax on solar installations and a property tax exemption for the added home value from solar panels. While Florida doesn't currently offer state rebates, FPL participates in net metering, allowing customers to receive credits for excess energy produced. Additionally, Fort Lauderdale has streamlined permitting processes for solar installations, reducing bureaucratic delays and costs for homeowners looking to go solar.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Fort Lauderdale</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in Fort Lauderdale, prioritize companies with proper Florida licensing, including electrical contractor licenses and solar certifications from organizations like NABCEP (North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners). Look for installers with extensive experience in Broward County who understand local building codes, hurricane-resistant mounting systems, and FPL's interconnection requirements. Quality installers should offer comprehensive warranties covering equipment (typically 20-25 years for panels, 10-12 years for inverters) and workmanship (minimum 5-10 years). Request multiple quotes, verify insurance coverage, check Better Business Bureau ratings, and read customer reviews specifically from Fort Lauderdale installations. Reputable companies will conduct thorough site assessments, provide detailed energy production estimates, and handle all permitting and utility interconnection paperwork.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Fort Lauderdale</h2>
<p>Based on Fort Lauderdale's electricity rate of 12.3¢/kWh and excellent solar conditions, homeowners typically see payback periods of 10-12 years for solar installations. A typical 6kW system costing \$12,600 after the 30% federal tax credit can generate approximately \$1,181 in annual electricity savings. Over 25 years, this system would provide total savings of approximately \$29,525, representing a strong return on investment. With electricity rates expected to increase 2-3% annually, actual savings will likely be higher. Fort Lauderdale's consistent sunshine and high air conditioning usage during peak rate periods maximize solar production when electricity is most expensive, improving overall ROI. Property values also increase by approximately 4% with solar installations, adding another \$15,000-\$20,000 in value for average Fort Lauderdale homes.</p>
