const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Fort Lauderdale</h2>
<p>Fort Lauderdale's hot-humid climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, with residents facing nearly year-round cooling demands and high humidity levels that can make indoor spaces uncomfortable without proper climate control. With temperatures regularly exceeding 85°F from May through October and humidity levels often above 70%, the city's 182,760 residents rely heavily on efficient air conditioning systems to maintain comfortable indoor environments. The subtropical climate means HVAC systems run almost continuously during peak summer months, making energy efficiency a critical consideration for homeowners looking to manage utility costs.</p>

<p>Energy costs in Fort Lauderdale are a significant factor in HVAC system selection, with Florida Power & Light (FPL) charging an average of 12.3¢ per kilowatt-hour. Given that cooling accounts for approximately 60-70% of energy usage in Broward County homes, selecting an efficient HVAC system can result in substantial long-term savings. The combination of high cooling loads and moderate electricity rates makes investing in higher-efficiency systems particularly attractive for Fort Lauderdale homeowners, as the energy savings can quickly offset the higher upfront costs of premium equipment.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Fort Lauderdale Climate</h2>
<p>For Fort Lauderdale's hot-humid climate, HVAC systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher are recommended to handle the extended cooling season efficiently. High-efficiency heat pumps are particularly well-suited for the area, as they provide excellent cooling performance while offering energy-efficient heating during the brief winter months when temperatures occasionally drop into the 50s and 60s. Variable-speed systems excel in humid climates like Fort Lauderdale's because they run longer at lower speeds, providing better humidity removal compared to single-stage systems. Since heating needs are minimal—typically only 10-15% of total HVAC usage—the focus should be on exceptional cooling performance and dehumidification capabilities. Systems with enhanced dehumidification features or separate dehumidifiers are valuable additions, as maintaining indoor humidity levels between 30-50% is crucial for comfort and preventing mold growth in the humid subtropical environment.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Fort Lauderdale</h2>
<p>Fort Lauderdale residents have access to several rebate programs that can significantly reduce HVAC upgrade costs. The federal tax credit allows homeowners to claim 30% of the cost of qualifying heat pumps and other efficient HVAC equipment, with no upper limit through 2032. FPL offers rebates up to \$1,600 for high-efficiency air conditioning systems and heat pumps that meet specific SEER and EER requirements, with additional rebates available for smart thermostats (\$50-100) and duct sealing services. Florida's Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program allows homeowners to finance energy-efficient HVAC upgrades through their property taxes, with no upfront costs and payments spread over 10-20 years. Additionally, some manufacturers offer seasonal rebates that can stack with utility and federal incentives, potentially reducing total system costs by \$2,000-4,000 for high-efficiency installations.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Fort Lauderdale</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in Fort Lauderdale requires careful attention to licensing, experience, and local climate expertise. All contractors must hold valid Florida state licenses and Broward County permits, with specialty certifications for handling refrigerants and working on specific equipment types. Look for contractors with at least 5-10 years of experience specifically in South Florida's humid climate, as proper system sizing and humidity control require specialized knowledge. Quality contractors should provide detailed written estimates, offer equipment warranties of 10+ years, and provide labor warranties of at least 2-3 years. Emergency service availability is crucial in Fort Lauderdale's climate, where AC failures during summer can create dangerous indoor conditions within hours. Verify contractor credentials through the Florida Department of Business Regulation, check Better Business Bureau ratings, and request recent local references. The best contractors will perform detailed load calculations, discuss humidity control options, and explain how different systems perform in Fort Lauderdale's specific climate conditions.</p>
