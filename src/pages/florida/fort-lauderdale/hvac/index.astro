const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Fort Lauderdale</h2>
<p>Fort Lauderdale's hot-humid climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, with residents facing cooling demands nearly year-round and humidity levels that often exceed 70%. The city's 182,760 residents rely heavily on air conditioning from March through November, with peak summer months requiring systems to operate continuously. This subtropical climate means HVAC units must not only cool effectively but also remove substantial moisture from the air to maintain indoor comfort and prevent mold growth.</p>

<p>With FPL's electricity rate of 12.3¢/kWh, Fort Lauderdale homeowners face significant cooling costs that can account for 60-70% of their annual energy bills. The combination of high humidity and temperatures regularly exceeding 85°F means that selecting the right HVAC system is crucial for both comfort and cost control. Energy-efficient systems with proper dehumidification capabilities can save homeowners \$500-1,200 annually compared to older, less efficient units, making system upgrades a smart financial investment in Broward County's demanding climate.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Fort Lauderdale Climate</h2>
<p>For Fort Lauderdale's hot-humid climate, high-efficiency air conditioning systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher are essential. The most recommended systems include variable-speed heat pumps with SEER ratings of 18-20, which provide superior humidity control and energy efficiency. Since heating needs are minimal in Fort Lauderdale—typically only 10-15 days per year require heating—focus should be on cooling performance and dehumidification capabilities. Two-stage or variable-speed compressors are particularly effective because they can run at lower speeds for longer periods, removing more moisture while maintaining consistent temperatures. Systems should include enhanced dehumidification features, as standard AC units may struggle to remove enough moisture during milder weather when cooling loads are reduced but humidity remains high.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Fort Lauderdale</h2>
<p>Fort Lauderdale residents can access multiple rebate programs to offset HVAC installation costs. Federal tax credits provide up to \$2,000 for qualifying heat pump installations and up to \$1,200 for high-efficiency air conditioning systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher. Florida Power & Light offers rebates ranging from \$150-500 for ENERGY STAR certified systems, with additional incentives for smart thermostats (\$50-100) and duct sealing services (\$200-400). The state of Florida provides property tax exemptions for renewable energy systems, and some municipalities in Broward County offer additional local incentives. Combined, these programs can reduce total installation costs by \$1,500-3,000, significantly improving the return on investment for high-efficiency systems in Fort Lauderdale's demanding climate.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Fort Lauderdale</h2>
<p>When selecting an HVAC contractor in Fort Lauderdale, verify they hold current Florida state licensing (requires both state and local licenses in Broward County) and carry comprehensive insurance coverage. Look for contractors with specific experience in hot-humid climates who understand the importance of proper system sizing, ductwork design, and humidity control. Reputable contractors should provide detailed load calculations using Manual J methodology rather than simple square footage estimates, as Fort Lauderdale's climate demands precise sizing to handle both sensible and latent cooling loads. Ensure they offer comprehensive warranties (minimum 5 years on equipment, 2 years on labor), provide 24/7 emergency service during peak summer months, and have established relationships with major manufacturers like Carrier, Trane, or Lennox. Request multiple references from recent installations in similar homes and verify their Better Business Bureau rating and local online reviews before making your decision.</p>
