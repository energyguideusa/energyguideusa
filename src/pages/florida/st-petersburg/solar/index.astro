const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in St Petersburg</h2>
<p>St Petersburg's hot-humid climate and abundant sunshine make it an ideal location for solar panel installation. With over 361 sunny days per year and Duke Energy's current electricity rate of 11.8¢/kWh, homeowners in this Pinellas County city of 265,351 residents are increasingly turning to solar energy to reduce their monthly utility bills. The consistent year-round sunshine in St Petersburg allows solar panels to generate substantial energy production, even during the humid summer months when air conditioning usage peaks and electricity demands are highest.</p>

<p>Installing solar panels in St Petersburg requires careful consideration of the local climate conditions. The hot-humid environment means selecting panels and mounting systems that can withstand high temperatures, occasional severe weather, and humidity levels that can affect equipment longevity. Professional installers in the area are experienced with Duke Energy's net metering policies, which allow homeowners to sell excess solar energy back to the grid at retail rates. This combination of favorable weather, reasonable electricity rates, and supportive utility policies creates an excellent opportunity for St Petersburg residents to achieve significant long-term energy savings through solar installation.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in St Petersburg</h2>
<p>St Petersburg residents have access to several valuable solar incentives that significantly reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit on the total system cost, including equipment and installation, through 2032. Florida offers additional benefits including no state income tax on solar investments, property tax exemptions for solar equipment value, and sales tax exemptions on solar equipment purchases. Duke Energy participates in net metering programs, allowing St Petersburg homeowners to receive credit for excess energy their solar panels produce and send back to the grid. While Duke Energy doesn't currently offer direct rebates for residential solar installations, their net metering program ensures customers receive retail rate credits for surplus solar production, maximizing the financial benefits of going solar in St Petersburg.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in St Petersburg</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in St Petersburg, prioritize companies with proper Florida licensing, extensive local experience, and strong warranty offerings. Look for contractors certified by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) and ensure they hold valid electrical contractor licenses in Florida. Reputable St Petersburg solar companies should provide comprehensive warranties covering equipment (typically 20-25 years for panels, 10-12 years for inverters) and workmanship (minimum 5-10 years). Request multiple quotes, verify insurance coverage, and check references from recent local installations. The best installers will conduct thorough site assessments, provide detailed energy production estimates based on St Petersburg's climate data, handle all permitting and Duke Energy interconnection requirements, and offer financing options. Avoid door-to-door sales tactics and high-pressure sales approaches, instead choosing established local companies with proven track records in Pinellas County.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in St Petersburg</h2>
<p>Solar panels in St Petersburg typically achieve payback periods of 14-16 years, with 25-year savings ranging from \$8,000 to \$15,000 depending on system size and energy usage. Based on Duke Energy's 11.8¢/kWh rate and St Petersburg's average annual solar irradiance of 5.27 kWh/m²/day, a typical 6kW system generates approximately 7,200 kWh annually, saving homeowners about \$850 per year in electricity costs. After accounting for the 30% federal tax credit, the net investment of \$12,600 pays for itself in approximately 14.8 years through energy savings. Over the 25-year warrantied life of the solar panels, homeowners can expect total savings of approximately \$21,250, representing a strong return on investment. These calculations assume modest annual electricity rate increases of 2-3%, meaning actual savings may be higher as utility rates continue to rise while solar production remains consistent.</p>
