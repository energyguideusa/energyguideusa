const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in St Petersburg, Florida</h2>
<p>St Petersburg, Florida presents exceptional opportunities for solar energy adoption and efficient HVAC systems. With its Hot-Humid climate, the city enjoys abundant sunshine year-round, making it one of the most productive regions for solar panel installations in the United States. The combination of high cooling demands and Duke Energy's electricity rates of 11.8¢ per kWh creates significant potential for energy savings through solar power and efficient HVAC systems.</p>

<p>For St Petersburg's 265,351 residents in Pinellas County, the transition to solar energy and high-efficiency HVAC systems represents both environmental responsibility and substantial long-term financial benefits. The Hot-Humid climate means air conditioning systems run extensively throughout the year, often accounting for 60-70% of total energy consumption in typical homes. By pairing solar panels with energy-efficient HVAC systems, homeowners can dramatically reduce their dependence on Duke Energy's grid power while maintaining optimal comfort in their 1,680 square foot average homes.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in St Petersburg reflect the competitive Florida market, with installed costs averaging \$2.70 per watt before incentives. The annual savings calculations are based on Duke Energy's 11.8¢ per kWh rate and St Petersburg's excellent solar irradiance of approximately 5.67 peak sun hours daily. Most homeowners in St Petersburg find that a 6-8kW system adequately covers their energy needs, especially when paired with energy-efficient HVAC systems.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for St Petersburg</h2>
<p>St Petersburg's Hot-Humid climate demands specialized HVAC considerations to maintain comfort while maximizing energy efficiency. The ideal HVAC system for this environment should feature a SEER rating of at least 16, with high-efficiency units reaching SEER 20+ providing optimal performance. Heat pumps are particularly effective in St Petersburg, as they can provide both heating and cooling while consuming significantly less energy than traditional systems.</p>

<p>Humidity control is crucial in St Petersburg's climate, making variable-speed air handlers and multi-stage cooling systems essential for optimal comfort. These systems run longer at lower speeds, providing superior dehumidification compared to single-stage units. For homes with solar panels, pairing a high-efficiency heat pump with a programmable or smart thermostat can maximize the use of daytime solar production. Ductless mini-split systems are also excellent options for St Petersburg homes, offering zoned comfort control and exceptional efficiency ratings up to SEER 30.</p>

<h2>St Petersburg Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>St Petersburg residents benefit from substantial solar incentives that make renewable energy installations highly attractive. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on the total cost of solar panel systems through 2032, reducing to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to all components including panels, inverters, installation, and permitting costs.</p>

<p>Florida offers additional advantages through its solar-friendly policies, including no state income tax on solar investments and property tax exemptions for solar installations. Duke Energy participates in net metering programs, allowing St Petersburg solar customers to sell excess electricity back to the grid at retail rates. While Duke Energy doesn't currently offer direct solar rebates, they provide energy efficiency rebates for qualifying HVAC systems, including up to \$1,500 for high-efficiency heat pumps and additional rebates for smart thermostats and duct sealing services.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in St Petersburg</h2>
<p>St Petersburg's diverse neighborhoods each present unique opportunities for solar and HVAC installations. The Historic Old Northeast features charming homes from the 1920s-1940s that often require careful HVAC upgrades and solar installations that complement architectural character. These homes typically benefit from ductless mini-split systems and roof-mounted solar arrays designed to minimize visual impact.</p>

<p>The Bayway Isles and Isla del Sol neighborhoods feature newer construction with better insulation and more modern electrical systems, making them ideal candidates for larger solar installations and high-efficiency central HVAC systems. Downtown St Petersburg's growing condo market presents opportunities for shared solar installations and individual high-efficiency HVAC units. The Kenwood and Lakewood Estates neighborhoods, with their mid-century homes and larger lots, often accommodate ground-mounted solar arrays and whole-home HVAC upgrades that dramatically improve comfort and efficiency.</p>
