const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Orlando</h2>
<p>Orlando's hot-humid climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, with temperatures regularly exceeding 90°F and humidity levels above 70% for much of the year. The city's 307,573 residents rely heavily on air conditioning systems that can handle both the intense heat and moisture removal demands. With Duke Energy's electricity rate at 11.6¢/kWh, Orlando homeowners face annual cooling costs that can exceed \$2,400 for poorly efficient systems, making proper HVAC selection crucial for both comfort and budget management.</p>

<p>The hot-humid climate means HVAC systems in Orange County must prioritize dehumidification alongside cooling. Systems that can't adequately remove moisture lead to uncomfortable indoor conditions, mold growth, and higher energy bills. Orlando's minimal heating requirements (only 2-3 months of mild winter weather) allow residents to focus on high-efficiency cooling systems rather than balanced heating/cooling units. Modern high-SEER air conditioners with variable-speed compressors and enhanced dehumidification capabilities are ideal for Orlando's climate conditions.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Orlando Climate</h2>
<p>For Orlando's hot-humid climate, high-efficiency air conditioning systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher are essential. The most effective systems combine superior cooling capacity with enhanced moisture removal features. Variable-speed air handlers and two-stage compressors excel in Orlando's conditions by running longer at lower speeds, providing better dehumidification while maintaining consistent temperatures. Heat pumps are particularly well-suited for Orlando, offering year-round efficiency with cooling in summer and gentle heating during the brief winter months. Systems with humidity control features can maintain indoor humidity levels between 40-50%, preventing mold growth and improving comfort. Given Orlando's 8-9 month cooling season, investing in 17+ SEER systems typically provides excellent returns through reduced electricity costs with Duke Energy's 11.6¢/kWh rates.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Orlando</h2>
<p>Orlando residents can access multiple rebate programs to offset HVAC installation costs. Federal tax credits provide up to \$2,000 for qualifying high-efficiency heat pumps and up to \$600 for central air conditioners with 16+ SEER ratings through 2032. Duke Energy offers rebates of \$75-300 for ENERGY STAR certified air conditioning systems and heat pumps, with additional incentives for smart thermostats (\$50-75 rebates). Florida's Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing programs allow Orlando homeowners to finance HVAC upgrades with no upfront costs, repaying through property tax assessments. The City of Orlando occasionally offers energy efficiency grants for qualifying residents, while Orange County provides low-interest loans for energy-efficient home improvements. Combining federal tax credits with Duke Energy rebates can reduce total HVAC installation costs by \$2,000-2,500, significantly improving payback periods for high-efficiency systems.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Orlando</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in Orlando requires verifying proper Florida licensing (contractors must hold active licenses through the Department of Business and Professional Regulation), insurance coverage, and local Better Business Bureau ratings. Experienced Orlando contractors understand hot-humid climate requirements and can properly size systems for moisture removal alongside cooling. Look for contractors offering comprehensive warranties (10+ years on equipment, 2+ years on labor) and 24/7 emergency service, crucial during Orlando's intense summer months. Reputable contractors provide detailed load calculations, explain ductwork modifications, and offer financing options. Request multiple quotes from established Orlando contractors, verify references from recent installations, and ensure they're familiar with Duke Energy rebate programs and permit requirements. The best contractors offer maintenance agreements to keep systems operating efficiently in Orlando's demanding climate, potentially extending equipment life by 5-7 years while maintaining peak performance.</p>
