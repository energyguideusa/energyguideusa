const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Orlando, Florida</h2>
<p>Orlando, Florida presents exceptional opportunities for solar energy adoption and efficient HVAC systems. With its Hot-Humid subtropical climate, the city receives abundant sunshine year-round, averaging over 230 sunny days annually. This consistent solar irradiance, combined with Duke Energy's electricity rates of 11.6¢ per kWh, creates compelling economics for residential solar installations. The 307,573 residents of Orange County can significantly reduce their energy costs through strategic solar and HVAC investments, particularly given the region's high cooling demands.</p>

<p>The Hot-Humid climate zone designation means Orlando homeowners face unique energy challenges, with air conditioning accounting for up to 70% of summer electricity bills. Duke Energy serves the Orlando market with traditional grid power, but the utility's net metering programs and interconnection policies support solar adoption. The average home size of 1,850 square feet in Orlando typically requires robust cooling systems and presents ample roof space for solar panel installations, making the combination of efficient HVAC and solar power an ideal solution for managing Florida's energy demands.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in Orlando average \$3.00 per watt installed, positioning the market competitively within Florida's solar landscape. The annual savings calculations assume Duke Energy's current rate of 11.6¢ per kWh and Orlando's solar irradiance of approximately 5.2 peak sun hours daily. Most Orlando homes with 1,850 square feet benefit from 6-8kW systems, which can offset 80-100% of typical electricity usage. Installation costs include equipment, permits, labor, and Duke Energy interconnection fees, with most systems paying for themselves within 8-10 years through electricity savings.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Orlando</h2>
<p>Orlando's Hot-Humid climate demands high-performance HVAC systems designed for continuous cooling loads and humidity control. The ideal system combines a minimum 16 SEER central air conditioner with enhanced dehumidification capabilities, as humidity levels regularly exceed 70% during summer months. Heat pumps rated at 18+ SEER provide optimal efficiency for Orlando's mild winters and intense summers, offering both heating and cooling in a single system that pairs exceptionally well with solar power generation.</p>

<p>For Orlando's 1,850 square foot average homes, properly sized 3-4 ton HVAC systems with variable-speed compressors deliver superior comfort and energy efficiency. Duct systems require careful attention to air sealing and insulation levels of R-8 minimum in Florida's climate. Smart thermostats with humidity control optimize solar power usage by pre-cooling homes during peak solar production hours, reducing grid dependency during Duke Energy's peak rate periods. Enhanced filtration systems are recommended due to Orlando's high pollen counts and humidity-related indoor air quality challenges.</p>

<h2>Orlando Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Orlando residents benefit from substantial solar incentives, beginning with the federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of 30% of total system costs through 2032. This credit applies to the full installed cost including panels, inverters, mounting systems, and installation labor. Florida's solar-friendly policies include property tax exemptions for solar installations, meaning the added home value from solar panels doesn't increase property taxes. Additionally, Florida has no state income tax, simplifying the financial benefits of the federal tax credit.</p>

<p>Duke Energy offers net metering for Orlando solar customers, crediting excess solar production at the full retail rate of 11.6¢ per kWh. While Duke Energy doesn't currently provide direct solar rebates, the utility offers energy efficiency rebates for high-performance HVAC systems that pair well with solar installations. The Florida PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) financing program is available in Orange County, allowing homeowners to finance solar and energy efficiency improvements through property tax assessments with no upfront costs.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Orlando</h2>
<p>Orlando's diverse neighborhoods each present unique opportunities for solar and HVAC optimization. Downtown Orlando's high-rise condos and historic districts may face HOA restrictions but benefit from newer construction standards and urban heat island effects that increase cooling demands. Winter Park and College Park feature established homes with mature tree canopies that provide natural cooling but may require strategic solar panel placement to avoid shading issues.</p>

<p>The Dr. Phillips and Windermere areas showcase larger luxury homes averaging 2,500+ square feet, making them ideal candidates for 8-10kW solar systems paired with high-efficiency multi-zone HVAC systems. Newer developments like Lake Nona and Horizon West often include energy-efficient construction and HOAs that support solar installations, with optimal roof orientations for maximum solar production. East Orlando neighborhoods including Avalon Park and Waterford Lakes feature newer construction with adequate electrical panels for solar integration and modern HVAC infrastructure.</p>
