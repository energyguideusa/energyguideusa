const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Orlando, Florida</h2>
<p>Orlando's hot-humid climate and abundant sunshine make it an ideal location for solar energy systems and efficient HVAC solutions. With over 230 sunny days per year and Duke Energy's electricity rate of 11.6¢/kWh, residents of Orange County can achieve significant savings through solar installations. The combination of high cooling demands due to Orlando's subtropical climate and rising energy costs creates a compelling case for homeowners to invest in renewable energy and high-efficiency HVAC systems.</p>

<p>For Orlando's 307,573 residents, the integration of solar panels with modern HVAC systems offers dual benefits: reduced electricity bills and improved home comfort. Duke Energy's net metering program allows solar customers to sell excess energy back to the grid, while the hot-humid climate necessitates year-round air conditioning, making energy efficiency a top priority. The average 1,850 square foot home in Orlando can particularly benefit from this combination, as cooling costs typically account for 40-50% of annual electricity usage in Central Florida.</p>

<p>Solar installation costs in Orlando average \$3.10 per watt before incentives, which is competitive with the national average. With Duke Energy's 11.6¢/kWh rate and Florida's exemption from state income tax on solar installations, most Orlando homeowners see payback periods of 8-10 years. The abundant sunshine in Central Florida allows solar systems to generate approximately 1,300-1,400 kWh per installed kW annually, making solar particularly cost-effective for offsetting high air conditioning costs.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Orlando</h2>
<p>Orlando's hot-humid climate demands HVAC systems designed for year-round cooling and dehumidification. The ideal system for Central Florida homes should feature a minimum SEER rating of 16-18, with variable-speed air handlers and enhanced dehumidification capabilities. Heat pumps are particularly well-suited for Orlando's mild winters, providing efficient heating on the rare occasions when temperatures drop below 60°F.</p>

<p>For the typical 1,850 square foot Orlando home, a 3.5 to 4-ton system capacity is usually appropriate, though proper load calculations considering insulation, windows, and orientation are essential. Two-stage or variable-speed compressors help maintain consistent temperatures and humidity levels while reducing energy consumption. Duct sealing and proper insulation are critical in Orlando's climate, as leaky ducts in hot attics can increase cooling costs by 20-30%. Smart thermostats paired with zoning systems can provide additional savings by optimizing cooling schedules around Duke Energy's peak demand periods.</p>

<h2>Orlando Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Orlando residents benefit from multiple incentive programs that make solar and HVAC upgrades more affordable. The federal Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on the total cost of solar installations through 2032, then stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Florida offers additional advantages with no state income tax and property tax exemptions for solar installations, meaning the added home value from solar panels won't increase property taxes.</p>

<p>Duke Energy Florida offers rebates for high-efficiency HVAC systems and smart thermostats through their energy efficiency programs. Qualifying heat pumps with SEER ratings of 16 or higher can receive rebates up to \$400, while smart thermostats earn \$25-\$50 rebates. The utility also provides time-of-use rate options that can benefit solar customers by offering higher credits for energy exported during peak afternoon hours. Additionally, PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) financing is available in Orange County, allowing homeowners to finance energy improvements through property tax assessments with no upfront costs.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Orlando</h2>
<p>Orlando's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. Downtown Orlando's high-rise condos and older buildings may face installation challenges but benefit from reduced cooling loads due to shared walls and urban shading. The historic College Park and Thornton Park neighborhoods feature charming older homes that may require electrical upgrades and careful historic preservation considerations during solar installations.</p>

<p>Suburban areas like Dr. Phillips, Windermere, and Winter Park feature larger homes with ample roof space ideal for solar installations, though mature tree canopy may require strategic panel placement. These affluent neighborhoods often see the greatest return on investment from high-end HVAC systems with advanced features like whole-home air purification and smart home integration. Newer developments in areas like Lake Nona and Baldwin Park typically have modern electrical systems and energy-efficient construction that complement solar installations, while master-planned communities may have HOA restrictions requiring architectural approval for visible solar panels.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Orlando</h2>
