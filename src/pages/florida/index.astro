<p>HVAC system selection in Florida should prioritize high SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) ratings, with minimum recommendations of 16 SEER for central air conditioning systems and 18+ SEER for optimal energy savings. Variable speed and two-stage systems provide superior humidity control and energy efficiency compared to single-stage units, making them particularly well-suited for Florida's climate. Professional load calculations are essential to properly size equipment, as oversized systems can lead to poor humidity control and increased energy consumption.</p>

<h2>Florida Incentives & Rebates</h2>

<p>Florida offers several attractive incentives that significantly reduce the cost of solar panel installations and energy-efficient HVAC systems. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) allows homeowners to deduct 30% of the total cost of solar panel systems from their federal taxes, with no cap on the credit amount. This incentive applies to the complete system cost, including equipment, installation, permits, and interconnection fees. The 30% credit rate is available through 2032, after which it will step down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034 before expiring for residential installations.</p>

<p>At the state level, Florida provides a valuable property tax exemption for renewable energy equipment, including solar panels and battery storage systems. This exemption means that the added value of solar installations does not increase property tax assessments, providing long-term savings throughout the system's lifetime. Additionally, Florida has no state income tax, allowing residents to fully benefit from federal tax credits without state tax complications. The state also offers sales tax exemptions on solar equipment, reducing upfront costs by eliminating the 6% state sales tax on solar components.</p>

<p>Florida Power & Light (FPL) and other major utilities offer net metering programs that provide full retail rate credit for excess solar energy exported to the grid. FPL's net metering program allows customers to offset their electricity consumption with solar production on a kilowatt-hour basis, effectively using the grid as a virtual battery.
