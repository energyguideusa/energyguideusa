const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Miami</h2>
<p>Miami's hot-humid climate creates unique HVAC challenges for the city's 442,241 residents. With year-round temperatures averaging 75-85°F and humidity levels regularly exceeding 70%, air conditioning systems run almost continuously, making energy efficiency crucial. The subtropical climate means cooling costs dominate energy bills, with minimal heating needs during brief winter months. High humidity also increases the workload on HVAC systems, as they must remove moisture while cooling, requiring robust dehumidification capabilities.</p>

<p>With electricity rates at 12.4¢/kWh through Florida Power & Light (FPL), Miami homeowners face substantial cooling costs, often spending \$1,800-3,000 annually on air conditioning. The combination of intense heat, persistent humidity, and salt air from the nearby ocean demands HVAC systems specifically designed for coastal subtropical conditions. Proper system sizing, high-efficiency ratings, and humidity control features become essential investments rather than luxuries, directly impacting both comfort and long-term operating costs in Miami-Dade County.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Miami Climate</h2>
<p>For Miami's hot-humid climate, high-efficiency air conditioning systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher are recommended, though 18+ SEER units provide optimal performance and cost savings. Variable-speed compressors and multi-stage systems excel in humid conditions by running longer at lower speeds, improving dehumidification while maintaining consistent temperatures. Heat pumps are particularly effective in Miami, providing efficient cooling year-round and adequate heating during the few cool days, with modern units maintaining efficiency even in temperatures above 95°F. Since heating needs are minimal—typically only 10-15 days per year require heating—cooling capacity and humidity control should be the primary considerations when sizing systems for Miami homes.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Miami</h2>
<p>Miami residents can access substantial HVAC rebates through multiple programs. Federal tax credits offer up to \$2,000 for heat pumps and up to \$600 for high-efficiency air conditioners meeting Energy Star requirements. Florida's energy programs provide additional incentives, including sales tax exemptions on Energy Star appliances. FPL offers some of the most generous utility rebates in the state, providing up to \$1,600 for qualifying high-efficiency heat pumps, \$400-800 for ENERGY STAR air conditioners, and additional rebates for smart thermostats and duct sealing. FPL also offers on-bill financing for qualified energy improvements, allowing customers to pay for upgrades through their monthly electric bill with no upfront costs, making high-efficiency systems more accessible to Miami homeowners.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Miami</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in Miami requires verifying Florida state licensing and local Miami-Dade County permits, as unlicensed work can void warranties and create safety hazards. Look for contractors with extensive experience in hot-humid climates who understand the specific challenges of salt air corrosion, hurricane preparedness, and humidity control. Quality contractors should provide detailed load calculations using Manual J methodology, offer comprehensive warranties of at least 5-10 years on installations, and maintain 24/7 emergency service availability—crucial during Miami's intense summer months. Verify insurance coverage, check Better Business Bureau ratings, and request references from recent installations in similar Miami neighborhoods to ensure the contractor understands local building codes and climate-specific requirements.</p>
