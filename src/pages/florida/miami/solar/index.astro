const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Miami</h2>

<p>Miami's hot-humid climate presents both opportunities and challenges for solar panel installations. With over 248 sunny days per year and intense solar irradiance averaging 5.2 kWh/m²/day, Miami residents can generate substantial electricity from rooftop solar systems. The city's tropical climate means consistent year-round solar production, making it an ideal location for photovoltaic systems. However, the high humidity, salt air from proximity to the ocean, and frequent afternoon thunderstorms require solar installations to use marine-grade components and proper mounting systems to withstand corrosion and wind loads.</p>

<p>With Florida Power & Light (FPL) charging Miami residents an average of 12.4¢/kWh, solar panels offer significant potential savings on monthly electricity bills. Miami's 442,241 residents face rising electricity costs, making solar an increasingly attractive investment. The combination of high electricity rates, abundant sunshine, and favorable net metering policies through FPL's solar interconnection program means homeowners can potentially eliminate their electric bills while building long-term equity. Miami-Dade County's streamlined permitting process and growing solar infrastructure make installation more accessible than ever for residential properties.</p>

<p>Solar installation costs in Miami typically range from \$2.50 to \$3.50 per watt before incentives, with the average Miami home requiring a 6-8kW system. These costs include high-quality panels rated for hurricane-force winds, corrosion-resistant mounting hardware essential for Miami's coastal environment, and professional installation by certified contractors. The annual savings calculations assume Miami's average solar production of 1,500 kWh per kW installed and FPL's net metering rate of 12.4¢/kWh, providing homeowners with substantial long-term financial benefits.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Miami</h2>

<p>Miami residents can take advantage of several valuable solar incentives to reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit on the total system cost through 2032, then decreases to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Florida offers additional benefits including no state income tax on solar investments, property tax exemption on added home value from solar installations, and sales tax exemption on solar equipment purchases. FPL participates in net metering, allowing Miami homeowners to sell excess solar electricity back to the grid at retail rates, effectively using the utility grid as a battery. Additionally, Miami-Dade County offers expedited permitting for residential solar installations, reducing soft costs and installation timelines. Some Miami neighborhoods also qualify for additional rebates through local sustainability programs and PACE financing options for qualified homeowners.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Miami</h2>

<p>Selecting the right solar installer in Miami requires careful evaluation of experience with local conditions and regulatory requirements. Look for companies with proper Florida electrical contractor licenses, NABCEP-certified installers, and extensive experience with Miami-Dade County permitting processes. Top installers should offer comprehensive warranties including 25-year panel performance warranties, 10-15 year inverter warranties, and workmanship guarantees covering installation quality. Given Miami's challenging weather conditions, prioritize companies that use hurricane-rated mounting systems, corrosion-resistant materials, and have experience with concrete tile and metal roofing common in South Florida. Check Better Business Bureau ratings, online reviews, and request references from recent local installations. Reputable installers will provide detailed energy production estimates, handle all permitting and utility interconnection paperwork, and offer monitoring systems to track system performance over time.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Miami</h2>

<p>Miami's solar return on investment is compelling due to the combination of high electricity rates, excellent solar resources, and strong incentive programs. Based on FPL's current rate of 12.4¢/kWh and Miami's solar irradiance levels, homeowners can expect payback periods of 10-12 years for quality solar installations. Over a typical 25-year system lifespan, Miami homeowners can save \$15,000-\$35,000 depending on system size and electricity usage patterns. These calculations assume 3% annual electricity rate increases, conservative system degradation of 0.5% annually, and current net metering policies. The strong Miami real estate market also benefits from solar installations, with studies showing solar homes sell for 3-4% premiums and spend 20% less time on the market. With Miami's year-round sunshine and rising electricity costs, solar installations typically generate positive cash flow within the first year after the payback period, providing decades of free electricity and substantial lifetime savings.</p>
