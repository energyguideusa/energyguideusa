const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Miami</h2>
<p>Miami's hot-humid subtropical climate creates ideal conditions for solar energy generation, with over 240 sunny days per year and an average of 5.5 peak sun hours daily. With FPL (Florida Power & Light) charging Miami residents an average of 12.4¢/kWh for electricity, homeowners in the city of 442,241 residents are increasingly turning to solar panels to reduce their energy costs and achieve greater energy independence. The consistent sunshine throughout the year means solar systems in Miami can generate substantial electricity, often producing enough to offset 90-100% of a home's energy needs.</p>

<p>Miami-Dade County's coastal location and year-round warmth make it one of Florida's premier solar markets. While the humid conditions require proper ventilation and quality mounting systems to ensure optimal panel performance, the abundant sunshine more than compensates for any climate-related considerations. FPL's net metering program allows Miami homeowners to sell excess solar energy back to the grid, further improving the economics of going solar. The combination of high electricity rates, excellent solar irradiance, and supportive policies makes Miami an attractive market for residential solar installations.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Miami</h2>
<p>Miami homeowners can take advantage of several solar incentives to reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit on the total cost of solar panel systems installed through 2032, making it the most valuable incentive available. Florida offers additional benefits including no state income tax on solar investments and a property tax exemption that prevents solar installations from increasing property tax assessments. While FPL doesn't currently offer cash rebates for solar installations, their net metering program allows customers to receive full retail credit for excess solar energy fed back into the grid, effectively using the utility grid as a battery. Miami-Dade County also provides expedited permitting processes for solar installations, reducing installation timelines and associated soft costs for homeowners.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Miami</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in Miami, prioritize companies with proper Florida licensing, including a certified electrical contractor license and solar contractor specialty license. Look for installers with extensive experience in Miami's unique climate conditions, including expertise with hurricane-resistant mounting systems and corrosion-resistant materials suitable for the coastal environment. Top-tier companies should offer comprehensive warranties covering panels (25 years), inverters (10-25 years), and workmanship (10+ years). Verify that installers are certified by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) and check Better Business Bureau ratings along with local customer reviews. Quality installers will provide detailed site assessments, custom system designs, and handle all permitting and utility interconnection processes. Given Miami's hurricane risk, ensure your installer uses IBC (International Building Code) compliant mounting systems designed for high wind loads.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Miami</h2>
<p>Miami's combination of high electricity rates at 12.4¢/kWh and excellent solar irradiance creates attractive returns on solar investments. A typical 6kW system costing \$15,600 (\$10,920 after federal tax credit) can save homeowners approximately \$1,339 annually, resulting in a payback period of 8.2 years. Over the 25-year lifespan of solar panels, Miami homeowners can expect total savings of \$33,475, representing a 206% return on investment. Larger systems offer even better economics due to scale efficiencies and higher energy offsets. With FPL's net metering program, excess production during peak sun hours offsets evening and cloudy day consumption, maximizing the value of every kilowatt-hour produced. Factor in Miami's rising electricity rates, which historically increase 2-3% annually, and the long-term savings become even more compelling. Property value increases of approximately 4% also add to the overall financial benefits of solar installation.</p>
