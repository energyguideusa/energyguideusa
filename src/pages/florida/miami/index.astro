const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Miami, Florida</h2>
<p>Miami's hot-humid climate and year-round sunshine make it an exceptional location for solar panel installations, with residents enjoying over 248 sunny days annually. The city's 442,241 residents face Florida Power & Light (FPL) electricity rates of 12.4¢/kWh, which are above the national average, creating substantial opportunities for solar savings. Miami's consistent solar irradiance of approximately 5.2 peak sun hours daily means homeowners can generate significant clean energy to offset their high cooling costs.</p>

<p>The combination of Miami's intense heat and humidity creates perfect conditions for pairing solar panels with efficient HVAC systems. With average home sizes of 1,680 square feet in Miami-Dade County, homeowners typically spend 60-70% of their energy bills on air conditioning during the lengthy cooling season that runs nearly year-round. Solar panels can directly power these energy-intensive HVAC systems, providing immediate relief from FPL's rising electricity costs while maintaining comfortable indoor temperatures in Miami's challenging climate.</p>

<p>Miami solar installations average \$3.15 per watt before incentives, making the city competitively priced compared to other major Florida markets. The high solar irradiance and FPL's net metering program allow Miami homeowners to achieve payback periods of 7-9 years. For the typical 1,680 square foot Miami home, a 6-8kW system provides optimal coverage for year-round energy needs, including heavy air conditioning usage during the extended cooling season from April through November.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Miami</h2>
<p>Miami's hot-humid climate demands high-efficiency HVAC systems capable of managing both temperature and humidity year-round. The optimal choice for Miami homes is a high-SEER central air conditioning system rated at minimum SEER 16, though SEER 18-20 systems provide superior performance and energy savings. Variable-speed air handlers paired with two-stage compressors excel in Miami's climate by maintaining consistent temperatures while effectively removing humidity, which is crucial for indoor air quality and comfort in this coastal environment.</p>

<p>For Miami's 1,680 square foot average homes, properly sized 2.5-3 ton systems typically provide adequate cooling capacity. However, proper sizing depends on factors including ceiling height, insulation quality, and window efficiency. Heat pumps offer year-round efficiency for the few mild days when heating is needed, while ductless mini-split systems work exceptionally well for Miami's many condominiums and homes with challenging ductwork layouts. Regular maintenance including coil cleaning and refrigerant checks is essential due to Miami's salt air and high humidity levels.</p>

<h2>Miami Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Miami residents benefit from multiple solar incentives starting with the federal Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which provides a 30% credit on total solar installation costs through 2032. This credit applies to equipment, installation labor, and associated electrical work. Florida's solar-friendly policies include property tax exemptions for solar installations, meaning the added home value from solar panels won't increase property taxes, and sales tax exemptions on solar equipment purchases.</p>

<p>FPL offers net metering for Miami solar customers, crediting excess solar production at retail rates and allowing homeowners to bank credits for nighttime and cloudy day usage. While FPL doesn't currently offer direct solar rebates, they provide energy efficiency rebates for high-SEER HVAC systems that pair perfectly with solar installations. Additionally, Miami-Dade County occasionally offers Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing programs, allowing homeowners to finance solar and HVAC improvements through property tax assessments with no upfront costs.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Miami</h2>
<p>Coral Gables and Coconut Grove feature many historic homes with mature tree canopies that require careful solar panel placement to maximize sun exposure while respecting architectural guidelines. These upscale neighborhoods often benefit from larger roof spaces suitable for 8-10kW systems. Brickell's high-rise condominiums present unique opportunities for shared solar installations and often feature modern HVAC systems that integrate well with renewable energy sources.</p>

<p>Downtown Miami and the Arts District contain a mix of older buildings requiring HVAC upgrades alongside new construction with solar-ready infrastructure. Wynwood and Little Havana neighborhoods offer excellent solar potential with lower installation costs due to simpler roof configurations, making solar accessible for a broader range of homeowners. Aventura and Key Biscayne coastal locations require specialized equipment resistant to salt air corrosion, but benefit from consistent ocean breezes that can improve solar panel efficiency through natural cooling.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Miami</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in Miami?</h3><p>Solar panels in Miami cost approximately \$3.15 per watt before incentives, meaning a typical 6kW system costs \$18,900 upfront but only \$13,230 after the 30% federal tax credit. Miami homeowners save an average of \$1,300-2,200 annually on electricity bills, with payback periods of 7-9 years thanks to FPL's 12.4¢/kWh rates and excellent year-round solar production.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Best HVAC for Miami climate?</h3><p>The best HVAC systems for Miami's hot-humid climate are high-efficiency central air conditioning units with SEER ratings of 16-20, paired with variable-speed air handlers for superior humidity control. Two-stage compressors provide consistent cooling while managing Miami's year-round humidity. Proper sizing (typically 2.5-3 tons for 1,680 sq ft homes) and regular maintenance are crucial for optimal performance in the coastal environment.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does FPL offer solar rebates?</h3><p>FPL doesn't currently offer direct cash rebates for solar installations, but provides valuable net metering that credits excess solar production at full retail rates (12.4¢/kWh). FPL does offer rebates for high-efficiency HVAC systems that complement solar installations. Miami residents primarily benefit from federal tax credits (30%), Florida's property tax exemptions for solar, and sales tax exemptions on solar equipment.</p></div>

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How long do solar panels last in Miami's climate?</h3><p>Quality solar panels in Miami typically last 25-30 years with proper installation and maintenance. Miami's intense UV exposure and occasional hurricanes require panels rated for 150+ mph winds and corrosion-resistant mounting systems. Regular cleaning to remove salt buildup and debris maintains optimal performance, while most manufacturers provide 20-25 year production warranties specifically covering Miami's challenging coastal conditions.</p></div>
