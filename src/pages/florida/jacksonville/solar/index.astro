const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Jacksonville</h2>
<p>Jacksonville's hot-humid climate and abundant sunshine make it an excellent location for solar panel installation. With over 220 sunny days per year and average daily solar irradiance of 4.5-5.0 kWh/m²/day, homeowners in Duval County can generate substantial electricity from rooftop solar systems. The city's current electricity rate of 11.9¢/kWh through JEA (Jacksonville Electric Authority) provides a solid foundation for solar savings, as each kilowatt-hour generated by your solar panels offsets this rate from your monthly bill.</p>

<p>The humid subtropical climate does present some considerations for solar installations. High humidity and occasional severe weather require robust mounting systems and panels rated for coastal conditions. However, modern solar panels are designed to withstand Florida's climate challenges, including high winds up to 140+ mph when properly installed. JEA's net metering program allows Jacksonville residents to sell excess solar power back to the grid, further enhancing the financial benefits of going solar in Northeast Florida.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Jacksonville</h2>
<p>Jacksonville homeowners can take advantage of several significant solar incentives. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on the total system cost through 2032, reducing to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Florida offers additional benefits including no state income tax on the federal credit amount, sales tax exemption on solar equipment, and property tax exemption for the added home value from solar installation. While JEA doesn't currently offer direct cash rebates, their net metering program credits customers at the full retail rate of 11.9¢/kWh for excess electricity sent back to the grid. Florida's solar rights laws also protect homeowners from HOA restrictions that would prohibit solar installations, ensuring your right to install solar panels regardless of neighborhood covenants.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Jacksonville</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in Jacksonville, prioritize companies with proper Florida licensing, including electrical contractor licenses and solar contractor certifications. Look for installers with extensive experience in Florida's climate conditions and familiarity with JEA's interconnection requirements. Top-tier companies should offer comprehensive warranties covering panels (25 years), inverters (10-25 years), and workmanship (10+ years). Verify the company's Better Business Bureau rating, read recent customer reviews, and request multiple quotes to compare pricing and equipment quality. Established Jacksonville solar installers will also handle all permitting with Duval County and JEA interconnection paperwork. Ensure your chosen contractor uses panels rated for high wind loads and humidity, such as those meeting Florida Building Code requirements for High Velocity Hurricane Zones.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Jacksonville</h2>
<p>Based on Jacksonville's electricity rate of 11.9¢/kWh and average solar production, homeowners typically see payback periods of 14-16 years for solar panel systems. A typical 6kW system costing \$12,600 after the federal tax credit will generate approximately \$857 annually in electricity savings. Over the 25-year panel warranty period, this system would produce total savings of approximately \$21,425, representing a strong return on investment of about \$8,800 in net profit. These calculations assume a modest 2% annual increase in electricity rates, which is conservative given JEA's historical rate increases. Factors that can improve ROI include higher electricity usage, optimal roof orientation (south-facing), minimal shading, and taking advantage of all available incentives. With JEA's full retail rate net metering, Jacksonville solar customers maximize their savings potential compared to utilities offering reduced credits for excess generation.</p>
