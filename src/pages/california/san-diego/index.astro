const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in San Diego, California</h2>
<p>San Diego's Mediterranean climate makes it one of the most favorable cities in the United States for solar energy systems. With over 260 sunny days per year and mild temperatures year-round, the city's 1,386,932 residents enjoy optimal conditions for solar panel efficiency. The consistent sunshine, combined with San Diego Gas & Electric's (SDG&E) high electricity rates of 32.4¢ per kWh, creates compelling economics for homeowners to invest in solar energy systems that can dramatically reduce their monthly utility bills.</p>

<p>The same Mediterranean climate that makes solar so attractive also creates unique opportunities for HVAC optimization in San Diego. Unlike cities with extreme temperature swings, San Diego's moderate climate allows homeowners to focus on energy-efficient cooling systems rather than robust heating solutions. When paired with solar panels, modern HVAC systems can operate at near-zero energy costs for much of the year, making the combination of solar and efficient HVAC one of the smartest home investments for San Diego residents.</p>

<p>For the average San Diego home of 1,920 square feet, a 6-8kW solar system typically provides optimal coverage. San Diego's excellent solar irradiance of 5.7 peak sun hours daily means these systems generate more electricity per panel than most U.S. locations. With SDG&E's high rates and time-of-use billing structure, solar panels installed in San Diego typically achieve payback periods of 6-8 years, making them among the most financially attractive solar investments in California.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for San Diego</h2>
<p>San Diego's Mediterranean climate requires HVAC systems optimized for mild winters and warm, dry summers. The average temperature rarely drops below 45°F or exceeds 85°F, meaning homeowners can prioritize efficient cooling over heavy-duty heating systems. For optimal performance and energy savings, San Diego homes should install air conditioning units with SEER ratings of 16-20, which provide excellent efficiency without the premium cost of ultra-high SEER units designed for extreme climates.</p>

<p>Heat pumps are particularly well-suited for San Diego's climate, as they can provide both heating and cooling efficiently in moderate temperature ranges. Mini-split systems work exceptionally well in San Diego's 1,920 square foot average homes, offering zone control that allows residents to cool only occupied areas. When paired with solar panels, a high-efficiency heat pump or mini-split system can operate at virtually no cost during peak solar production hours, maximizing the value of both investments.</p>

<p>For San Diego homes built before 1990, ductwork inspection and sealing should be prioritized before any HVAC upgrade. The city's older neighborhoods often have leaky ducts in unconditioned spaces, which can reduce system efficiency by 20-30%. Smart thermostats are also highly recommended for San Diego homes, as they can optimize cooling schedules to align with solar production and SDG&E's time-of-use rates.</p>

<h2>San Diego Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>San Diego residents have access to several attractive incentives that significantly reduce the cost of solar and HVAC installations. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit for solar panel systems installed through 2032, which can save San Diego homeowners \$4,500-\$10,500 on typical residential installations. This credit applies to the full system cost, including panels, inverters, mounting equipment, and installation labor.</p>

<p>California's Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) offers rebates for battery storage systems, which are increasingly popular in San Diego due to SDG&E's high time-of-use rates and occasional Public Safety Power Shutoffs. The SGIP provides rebates of \$150-\$1,000 per kWh of battery capacity, making solar-plus-storage systems more affordable for San Diego homeowners.</p>

<p>SDG&E offers several programs that benefit solar and HVAC upgrades, including net metering for solar customers and rebates for high-efficiency HVAC equipment through their Energy Efficiency programs. The utility's Time-of-Use rates also create additional savings opportunities for homeowners with solar panels, as excess solar production during mid-day hours can offset expensive evening electricity usage.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in San Diego</h2>
<p>Different San Diego neighborhoods present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. Coastal areas like La Jolla, Mission Beach, and Point Loma benefit from ocean breezes that reduce cooling needs but may require corrosion-resistant HVAC equipment due to salt air exposure. These neighborhoods often have higher property values and strict architectural guidelines that may influence solar panel placement and equipment selection.</p>

<p>Inland neighborhoods such as Scripps Ranch, Rancho Penasquitos, and Carmel Mountain Ranch experience higher temperatures and greater cooling demands, making larger solar systems and higher-capacity HVAC equipment more beneficial. These areas typically have newer homes with better insulation and more suitable roof orientations for solar installations.</p>

<p>Historic neighborhoods like Hillcrest, North Park, and South Park often feature older homes that may require electrical upgrades or roof reinforcement before solar installation. However, these centrally located neighborhoods have excellent solar exposure and can achieve significant savings due to their typically higher electricity usage in older, less efficient homes.</p>

<h2>FAQs for San Diego</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in San Diego?</h3><p>Solar panel systems in San Diego typically cost \$3.00-\$3.50 per watt before incentives. For a typical 6kW system suitable for a 1,920 square foot home, expect to pay \$18,000-\$21,000 before the 30% federal tax credit, or \$12,600-\$14,700 after the credit. With SDG&E's high rates of 32.4¢/kWh, most systems pay for themselves within 6-8 years.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">What's the best HVAC system for San Diego's climate?</h3><p>Heat pumps and mini-split systems are ideal for San Diego's Mediterranean climate. Look for units with SEER ratings of 16-20 for optimal efficiency without overpaying for features needed in extreme climates. Variable-speed systems work particularly well in San Diego's moderate climate, providing precise temperature control while maximizing energy efficiency.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does SDG&E offer solar rebates?</h3><p>While SDG&E no longer offers direct solar rebates, they provide net metering that credits solar customers for excess electricity sent to the grid. SDG&E also offers rebates for energy-efficient HVAC equipment and participates in California's SGIP program for battery storage rebates. The utility's time-of-use rates create additional savings opportunities for solar customers.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How long does it take to install solar panels in San Diego?</h3><p>Solar installations in San Diego typically take 1-3 months from contract signing to system activation. This includes permitting (2-4 weeks), installation (1-3 days), city inspection (1-2 weeks), and SDG&E interconnection approval (2-6 weeks). San Diego's streamlined permitting process is faster than many California cities.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Can I run my HVAC system entirely on solar power in San Diego?</h3><p>Yes, San Diego's excellent solar conditions make it possible to power HVAC systems entirely with solar energy for much of the year. A properly sized solar system paired with an efficient heat pump can provide net-zero cooling costs. Battery storage can extend solar-powered HVAC operation into evening hours when electricity rates are highest.</p></div>
