const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in San Diego, California</h2>
<p>San Diego's Mediterranean climate makes it one of the most attractive markets in California for solar panel installations and efficient HVAC systems. With over 260 sunny days per year and mild temperatures year-round, the city of 1,386,932 residents enjoys ideal conditions for solar energy production. The consistent sunshine allows homeowners to maximize their solar investment while reducing dependence on SDG&E's grid electricity, which currently costs 32.4¢ per kWh—one of the highest rates in the nation.</p>

<p>The combination of high electricity rates from San Diego Gas & Electric and abundant solar resources creates compelling economics for residential solar installations. Meanwhile, San Diego's Mediterranean climate—characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters—requires HVAC systems that can efficiently handle cooling loads during peak summer months while providing occasional heating during cooler periods. The average home size of 1,920 square feet in San Diego County presents optimal opportunities for both rooftop solar installations and right-sized HVAC systems that can work together to minimize energy costs.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in San Diego average \$3.10 to \$3.30 per watt installed, which is competitive with state averages despite higher labor costs. The annual savings calculations above are based on SDG&E's current residential rate of 32.4¢ per kWh and assume average annual production of 1,500 kWh per kW of installed capacity. Most San Diego homes between 1,500-2,500 square feet will benefit from a 6kW to 8kW system, which can offset 80-100% of typical electricity usage. With SDG&E's tiered rate structure and time-of-use pricing, solar installations become even more valuable as they reduce consumption during peak rate periods.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for San Diego</h2>
<p>San Diego's Mediterranean climate requires HVAC systems optimized for cooling efficiency rather than heating capacity. The ideal system for most San Diego homes is a high-efficiency air conditioning unit with a SEER rating of 16-20, paired with a heat pump or minimal heating system for the occasional cool days. Given that temperatures rarely drop below 40°F or exceed 85°F near the coast, homeowners can prioritize cooling performance and energy efficiency over heating capacity.</p>

<p>For coastal areas like La Jolla, Pacific Beach, and Mission Beach, a 16 SEER system is often sufficient due to the ocean's moderating effect on temperatures. However, inland areas such as Poway, Scripps Ranch, and Rancho Bernardo experience higher temperatures and benefit from 18-20 SEER systems. Variable-speed heat pumps are increasingly popular in San Diego because they provide efficient cooling during summer months and adequate heating during winter, while also offering superior humidity control and quieter operation. The average 1,920 square foot home typically requires a 2.5 to 3-ton capacity system, though proper load calculations should always be performed to account for insulation, windows, and home orientation.</p>

<h2>San Diego Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>San Diego residents can take advantage of multiple incentive programs to reduce the cost of solar and HVAC installations. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on the total cost of solar panel systems installed through 2032, then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the full system cost including equipment, installation, and permitting fees, making it one of the most valuable solar incentives available.</p>

<p>At the state level, California's Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) offers rebates for battery storage systems that pair with solar installations. While SDG&E discontinued most solar rebates due to high adoption rates, they continue to offer rebates for energy-efficient HVAC systems through their Energy Efficiency programs. The utility provides rebates ranging from \$75 to \$400 for qualifying high-efficiency air conditioners, heat pumps, and smart thermostats. Additionally, San Diego County and many municipalities offer expedited permitting and reduced fees for solar installations, helping to lower soft costs and installation timelines.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in San Diego</h2>
<p>Different San Diego neighborhoods present unique opportunities and considerations for solar and HVAC installations. Coastal communities like La Jolla, Del Mar, and Coronado benefit from mild temperatures year-round but may face marine layer conditions that slightly reduce solar production during morning hours. These areas typically require smaller HVAC systems due to the ocean's cooling effect but should invest in corrosion-resistant equipment due to salt air exposure.</p>

<p>Inland neighborhoods such as Rancho Bernardo, Poway, and Scripps Ranch experience more temperature variation and higher cooling loads, making them ideal candidates for larger solar arrays and higher-efficiency HVAC systems. Central neighborhoods like Hillcrest, North Park, and Mission Hills often feature older homes that may require electrical upgrades for solar installations but offer excellent solar exposure due to established tree canopies being less dense. South Bay communities including Chula Vista and National City have seen significant solar adoption due to newer construction and favorable roof orientations, while East County areas like Santee and El Cajon benefit from higher solar irradiance levels despite greater temperature extremes.</p>

<h2>FAQs for San Diego</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in San Diego?</h3><p>Solar panels in San Diego cost between \$11,550 and \$21,000 after the 30% federal tax credit for typical residential systems ranging from 5kW to 10kW. The average cost per watt is \$3.10-\$3.30 installed, with most homeowners choosing 6kW to 8kW systems costing \$13,440 to \$17,360 after incentives. With SDG&E's high electricity rates of 32.4¢ per kWh, these systems typically pay for themselves in 4-6 years through energy savings.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Best HVAC for San Diego climate?</h3><p>The best HVAC system for San Diego's Mediterranean climate is a high-efficiency air conditioner or heat pump with a SEER rating of 16-20. Coastal areas can use 16 SEER systems effectively, while inland areas benefit from 18-20 SEER units. Variable-speed heat pumps are ideal because they provide efficient cooling during warm months and adequate heating during mild winters, while offering better humidity control and quieter operation than traditional systems.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does SDG&E offer solar rebates?</h3><p>SDG&E no longer offers direct solar rebates due to high adoption rates and the success of net metering programs. However, they do provide rebates for energy-efficient HVAC equipment ranging from \$75-\$400, and battery storage systems may qualify for California's SGIP program. The primary solar incentive remains the federal 30% tax credit, combined with SDG&E's net metering program that credits excess solar production at retail rates.</p></div>

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much can I save with solar in San Diego?</h3><p>San Diego homeowners can save \$2,400-\$4,800 annually with solar installations, depending on system size and energy usage. With SDG&E's high rates of 32.4¢ per kWh and excellent solar conditions producing 1,400-1,600 kWh per kW annually, most systems achieve 15-25% annual returns on investment. Over 25 years, total savings typically range from \$60,000 to \$120,000, making solar one of the best investments for San Diego property owners.</p></div>
