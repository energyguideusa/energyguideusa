const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in San Diego</h2>
<p>San Diego's Mediterranean climate presents unique HVAC challenges for its 1,386,932 residents. With mild, wet winters averaging 57°F and warm, dry summers reaching 72°F, the region requires cooling systems capable of handling temperature swings and occasional heat waves that can push temperatures into the 90s. The coastal influence means humidity control is equally important, as marine layer moisture can create comfort issues without proper ventilation and dehumidification.</p>

<p>Energy efficiency is paramount in San Diego due to SDG&E's high electricity rates of 32.4¢/kWh—nearly triple the national average. This makes choosing the right HVAC system critical for long-term affordability. Homeowners who select high-efficiency systems can see dramatic reductions in their monthly utility bills, with some saving \$200-400 annually compared to older, less efficient units. The Mediterranean climate's moderate heating needs also make heat pumps an attractive option, providing both heating and cooling while consuming significantly less energy than traditional systems.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for San Diego Climate</h2>
<p>For San Diego's Mediterranean climate, high-efficiency heat pumps with SEER ratings of 18-20 offer the best value proposition. These systems excel in the region's moderate temperature ranges and can efficiently provide both heating and cooling year-round. Since heating demand is minimal—typically only 200-400 heating degree days annually—heat pumps avoid the inefficiency of gas furnaces during the brief winter months. Variable-speed compressors are particularly beneficial, allowing the system to adjust output based on actual cooling needs rather than cycling on and off, which improves humidity control during the marine layer season. For homes without existing ductwork, ductless mini-split systems with 22+ SEER ratings provide exceptional efficiency and zoned comfort control, perfect for San Diego's indoor-outdoor lifestyle.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in San Diego</h2>
<p>San Diego residents have access to substantial rebates that can offset 20-30% of HVAC installation costs. The federal tax credit provides 30% of the total cost for qualifying heat pumps and high-efficiency systems through 2032, potentially saving \$2,000-3,000. California's Tech Clean program offers additional rebates of \$3,000-4,000 for electric heat pumps that replace gas systems. SDG&E provides rebates ranging from \$75-200 for ENERGY STAR certified air conditioners and up to \$500 for high-efficiency heat pumps. The utility also offers the Energy Efficiency Loan Program with 0% APR financing for qualified energy improvements. San Diego County occasionally runs additional rebate programs for low-income households, providing up to \$6,000 in assistance for HVAC replacements. Combining these programs can reduce out-of-pocket costs by \$5,000-8,000 for qualifying installations.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in San Diego</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in San Diego requires careful attention to licensing, experience, and local expertise. Ensure contractors hold both a California C-20 license and are bonded and insured. Look for contractors with specific experience in coastal installations, as salt air requires specialized knowledge for equipment longevity. Request detailed load calculations using Manual J methodology to ensure proper system sizing—oversized units common in San Diego waste energy and fail to control humidity effectively. Quality contractors should offer comprehensive warranties: 10+ years on equipment, 2-5 years on labor, and lifetime warranties on ductwork. Emergency service availability is crucial during heat waves when temperatures can spike unexpectedly. Get multiple quotes, verify Better Business Bureau ratings, and check recent customer reviews focusing on post-installation service quality. Reputable contractors will also help navigate rebate applications and provide energy efficiency projections based on SDG&E's time-of-use rates.</p>
