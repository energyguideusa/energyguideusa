const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in San Jose</h2>
<p>San Jose's Mediterranean climate presents unique HVAC challenges for its 1,013,240 residents across Santa Clara County. With mild, wet winters averaging 50-60°F and warm, dry summers reaching 80-85°F, homeowners need versatile systems that efficiently handle both heating and cooling demands. The region's moderate temperatures mean HVAC systems run year-round but rarely at extreme capacity, making energy efficiency crucial for managing costs with PG&E's high electricity rates of 28.1¢/kWh.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean climate's distinct seasons require strategic HVAC planning. Summer cooling loads are significant but not extreme, while winter heating needs are moderate due to the temperate conditions. This climate profile makes San Jose ideal for heat pump systems, which can efficiently provide both heating and cooling. With energy costs among the highest in the nation, investing in high-efficiency HVAC equipment becomes even more critical for long-term savings, as a typical San Jose home can spend \$1,500-2,500 annually on HVAC-related electricity costs.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for San Jose Climate</h2>
<p>San Jose's Mediterranean climate is perfectly suited for heat pump systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher and HSPF ratings above 9.0. Heat pumps excel in moderate climates like San Jose's because they efficiently extract heat from outdoor air even when temperatures drop to the 40s, which rarely occurs here. For optimal performance, consider variable-speed heat pumps that can adjust output to match the mild temperature swings typical of the region. Traditional central air conditioning with 16-18 SEER ratings also performs well, but since San Jose requires both heating and cooling, heat pumps provide superior year-round efficiency. Ductless mini-split systems are increasingly popular for their zone control capabilities, allowing residents to cool specific areas during warm afternoons while maintaining comfortable temperatures in unused spaces, maximizing energy savings given PG&E's high rates.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in San Jose</h2>
<p>San Jose residents can access substantial rebates to offset HVAC installation costs. Federal tax credits provide up to \$2,000 for qualifying heat pumps and up to \$600 for high-efficiency air conditioners installed through 2032. California's statewide programs offer additional incentives, with the Self-Generation Incentive Program providing rebates for heat pump water heaters. PG&E customers can receive rebates up to \$1,500 for ENERGY STAR certified central air conditioners, \$2,000 for qualifying heat pumps, and \$1,000 for ductless heat pump systems. The utility also offers \$400-800 rebates for smart thermostats when paired with qualifying equipment. Low-income households may qualify for additional assistance through PG&E's Energy Savings Assistance Program, which can provide free HVAC upgrades. Combined, these programs can reduce total installation costs by \$3,000-5,000, making high-efficiency systems more affordable for San Jose homeowners facing the area's elevated energy costs.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in San Jose</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in San Jose requires verifying California state licensing (C-20 HVAC license), which you can check through the Contractors State License Board website. Look for contractors with extensive local experience who understand the specific requirements of San Jose's Mediterranean climate and PG&E's rate structures. Reputable contractors should provide detailed load calculations to properly size systems for your home, ensuring optimal efficiency and comfort. Request multiple quotes and compare not just prices but equipment specifications, warranty coverage, and installation timelines. Quality contractors offer comprehensive warranties on both equipment and labor, typically 5-10 years on major components. Given San Jose's year-round HVAC usage, choose contractors who provide 24/7 emergency service and have established relationships with major equipment manufacturers. Check online reviews on Google, Yelp, and Better Business Bureau, focusing on recent customer experiences with similar installations. Contractors should also be knowledgeable about available rebates and assist with paperwork to maximize your savings on the significant upfront investment required in San Jose's expensive market.</p>
