const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in San Jose</h2>
<p>San Jose's Mediterranean climate presents unique HVAC challenges for the city's 1,013,240 residents. With warm, dry summers reaching into the 80s and 90s and mild winters rarely dropping below 40°F, homeowners need efficient cooling systems that can handle extended periods of heat while providing minimal heating during cooler months. The region's low humidity and significant temperature swings between day and night make proper system sizing and zoning crucial for optimal comfort and energy efficiency.</p>

<p>Energy costs are a major consideration in San Jose, with PG&E's electricity rates at 28.1¢/kWh - significantly higher than the national average. This makes selecting an energy-efficient HVAC system critical for controlling monthly utility bills. Smart homeowners are increasingly choosing high-efficiency heat pumps and variable-speed systems that can adapt to the Mediterranean climate's fluctuating demands while minimizing energy consumption during peak rate periods.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for San Jose Climate</h2>
<p>For San Jose's Mediterranean climate, heat pumps with SEER ratings of 16 or higher offer the best value proposition. These systems efficiently handle both cooling during hot summer months and provide adequate heating during mild winters without the need for separate furnaces. Variable-speed heat pumps are particularly well-suited for the region's temperature fluctuations, automatically adjusting output to maintain consistent comfort while using 30-40% less energy than single-speed units. Since cooling demands far exceed heating needs in San Jose, prioritize systems with higher SEER ratings (18-20+) over high heating efficiency ratings. Multi-zone systems work exceptionally well in larger homes, allowing different temperature control for sun-facing rooms versus shaded areas - crucial given the significant solar heat gain typical in Santa Clara County.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in San Jose</h2>
<p>San Jose residents have access to substantial HVAC rebates that can reduce installation costs by thousands of dollars. Federal tax credits offer up to \$2,000 for qualifying heat pumps and central air systems installed through 2032. California's Tech Clean program provides additional rebates of \$1,000-3,000 for high-efficiency heat pumps, with enhanced incentives for low-income households. PG&E offers rebates ranging from \$500-1,500 for ENERGY STAR certified systems, plus additional incentives for smart thermostats (\$75-125) and ductwork improvements. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District also provides up to \$9,500 in rebates for replacing gas furnaces with electric heat pumps, making the switch to all-electric systems highly attractive. Combined, these programs can offset 20-40% of total installation costs for qualifying high-efficiency systems.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in San Jose</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in San Jose requires verifying proper licensing through the California State License Board (C-20 HVAC license required), checking Better Business Bureau ratings, and confirming liability insurance coverage. Look for contractors with extensive experience in Mediterranean climates who understand the specific challenges of Santa Clara County's temperature patterns and PG&E's rate structures. Quality contractors will perform detailed load calculations using Manual J procedures, recommend appropriate system sizing (avoiding oversizing common in the area), and provide comprehensive warranties covering both equipment (10+ years) and labor (2+ years minimum). Emergency service availability is crucial during heat waves, so choose contractors offering 24/7 support with guaranteed response times under 4 hours for system failures during extreme weather events.</p>
