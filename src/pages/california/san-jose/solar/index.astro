const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in San Jose</h2>
<p>San Jose's Mediterranean climate makes it an ideal location for solar panel installation, with over 300 sunny days per year and minimal weather-related disruptions. With PG&E's electricity rates at 28.1¢ per kWh—significantly higher than the national average—the 1,013,240 residents of Santa Clara County's largest city can achieve substantial savings by switching to solar power. The combination of abundant sunshine and high utility costs creates compelling economics for solar adoption.</p>

<p>The city's commitment to renewable energy, coupled with California's aggressive clean energy goals, has created a robust solar infrastructure throughout San Jose. Local permitting processes have been streamlined to encourage solar adoption, and the Mediterranean climate ensures consistent year-round energy production. With PG&E's tiered rate structure and time-of-use pricing, solar panels can offset the highest-cost electricity usage during peak hours, maximizing savings for homeowners and businesses alike.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in San Jose</h2>
<p>San Jose residents can take advantage of multiple solar incentives to reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit on the total system cost, including equipment and installation, through 2032. California's Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) offers rebates for solar-plus-battery systems, particularly valuable given PG&E's Public Safety Power Shutoffs during fire season. Additionally, PG&E's Net Energy Metering (NEM 2.0) program allows solar customers to receive retail rate credits for excess electricity sent back to the grid, though new interconnections are transitioning to NEM 3.0 with reduced compensation rates. Property tax exemptions ensure that adding solar panels won't increase property taxes, while the increased home value from solar installation remains tax-free.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in San Jose</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in San Jose, prioritize companies with proper California Contractors State License Board (CSLB) licensing, specifically C-46 Solar classification. Look for installers with extensive local experience who understand San Jose's permitting requirements and PG&E interconnection procedures. Top-tier companies should offer comprehensive warranties covering equipment (25 years on panels, 10-12 years on inverters) and workmanship (typically 10 years). Verify installer certifications from manufacturers like Tesla, SunPower, or Enphase, and check Better Business Bureau ratings plus local references. Given San Jose's competitive market, obtain quotes from at least three licensed installers, ensuring each proposal includes detailed production estimates based on your roof's orientation, shading analysis, and PG&E rate schedule. Reputable installers will also handle all permitting, utility interconnection paperwork, and provide post-installation monitoring support.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in San Jose</h2>
<p>Solar panel systems in San Jose typically achieve payback periods of 6-7 years due to PG&E's high electricity rates of 28.1¢ per kWh. A typical 6kW system costing \$12,600 after federal tax credits can generate approximately \$2,023 in annual savings, leading to over \$38,000 in total savings over 25 years. The strong return on investment stems from San Jose's excellent solar irradiance levels—averaging 5.38 peak sun hours daily—combined with PG&E's tiered rate structure that charges premium rates for higher usage levels. With panel warranties guaranteeing 80-90% performance after 25 years, and considering California's 2.5% annual electricity rate inflation, the lifetime value of a solar investment in San Jose often exceeds \$50,000. Property value increases of 3-4% further enhance the financial benefits, making solar panels one of the most attractive home improvements available to San Jose residents.</p>

<h2>San Jose Solar Installation Process</h2>
<p>The solar installation process in San Jose typically takes 4-8 weeks from contract signing to system activation. Initial steps include site assessment, custom system design, and obtaining financing approval. The installer handles permit applications with the City of San Jose, which typically processes residential solar permits within 2-3 business days for standard installations. Installation itself usually takes 1-2 days for residential systems, followed by city inspection and PG&E interconnection approval. San Jose has adopted expedited permitting for solar projects meeting standard requirements, and many installations qualify for same-day inspection scheduling. Once PG&E grants Permission to Operate (PTO), homeowners can begin generating solar credits immediately.</p>
