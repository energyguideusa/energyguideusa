const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>California stands as one of the most favorable states in the nation for both solar panel installations and efficient HVAC systems. The Golden State receives an average of 5.5 sun hours per day, providing exceptional solar energy potential that significantly exceeds the national average. This abundant sunshine, combined with California's high electricity rates averaging 19.9¢ per kilowatt-hour, creates compelling economics for homeowners considering renewable energy solutions. The state's commitment to clean energy through initiatives like the California Solar Initiative and Title 24 building standards has established a robust infrastructure supporting solar adoption.</p>

<p>Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), serving as the primary utility provider for Northern and Central California, along with Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, have implemented net metering programs that allow solar customers to receive credit for excess energy production. California's Mediterranean climate presents unique HVAC challenges, with hot, dry summers requiring efficient cooling systems and mild winters necessitating minimal heating. The combination of high energy costs, abundant sunshine, and supportive regulatory environment makes California an ideal market for integrated solar and HVAC solutions.</p>

<p>The state's aggressive renewable energy goals, including the mandate for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045, have created additional incentives and rebate programs that substantially reduce the upfront costs of solar and energy-efficient HVAC systems. These factors, combined with California's high property values that support strong return on investment for home improvements, establish the state as a premier market for residential energy efficiency upgrades.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in California</h2>
<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>California's exceptional solar resource stems from its unique geographic position and climate patterns. The state receives between 4.5 to 7.5 peak sun hours daily depending on location, with inland areas like Fresno and Bakersfield achieving the highest solar production potential. Coastal regions, while experiencing some marine layer interference, still maintain excellent solar conditions with 5.0 to 6.0 peak sun hours daily. This consistent solar irradiance allows a typical residential solar system to generate 1,300 to 1,600 kWh per installed kilowatt annually.</p>

<p>The state's diverse microclimates create varying solar production scenarios. Northern California cities like Sacramento and San Francisco experience seasonal variations, with summer production exceeding winter output by 40-60%. Southern California maintains more consistent year-round production, with areas like Los Angeles and San Diego showing only 20-30% seasonal variation. Desert regions including Palm Springs and Lancaster achieve the state's highest solar yields, often exceeding 1,700 kWh per kW annually.</p>

<p>California's solar production capacity is further enhanced by the state's relatively low humidity and minimal cloud cover during peak solar months. The dry climate reduces atmospheric interference, allowing solar panels to operate at optimal efficiency. Additionally, the mild temperatures in many coastal areas prevent the efficiency losses associated with extreme heat, while inland areas benefit from intense solar irradiance that compensates for higher temperature derating.</p>

<p>California offers some of the nation's most generous incentive programs for solar panels and energy-efficient HVAC systems. The federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit for solar installations through 2032, with the credit stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the entire cost of solar installation, including equipment, labor, and permitting fees, making it one of the most valuable incentives available to California homeowners.</p>

<p>The Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) provides substantial rebates for energy storage systems, offering up to \$1,000 per kilowatt-hour of installed battery capacity. Low-income customers and those in high fire-threat districts can receive enhanced incentives up to \$1,000 per kWh. SGIP has allocated over \$1.2 billion for energy storage projects, making California the nation's largest residential battery storage market. The program also supports fuel cells and other advanced energy technologies with similar rebate structures.</p>

<p>PG&E, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric offer various rebate programs for high-efficiency HVAC equipment. PG&E's Energy Efficiency Rebates provide up to \$3,000 for qualifying heat pump installations and \$1,500 for high-efficiency air conditioning systems. Additional rebates are available for smart thermostats (\$75-\$125), duct sealing services (\$400-\$600), and whole-house fans (\$200-\$400). The California Alternative Rates for Energy (CARE) program provides additional discounts for qualified low-income customers, reducing electricity bills by 30-35%.</p>

<p>Local utility districts and municipalities often provide additional incentive layers. Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) offers SolarShares programs and additional HVAC rebates. Many cities provide expedited permitting for solar installations and reduced permit fees. Property tax exclusions ensure that solar installations don't increase property tax assessments, while net metering programs provide ongoing credits for excess solar production.
