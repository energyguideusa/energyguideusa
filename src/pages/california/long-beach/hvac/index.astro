const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Long Beach</h2>
<p>Long Beach's Mediterranean climate presents unique HVAC challenges for its 466,742 residents. With mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers, homeowners need systems that efficiently handle cooling demands from May through October while providing occasional heating during cooler months. The coastal location moderates temperature extremes, but humidity from the Pacific Ocean requires proper dehumidification capabilities. Most Long Beach homes rely heavily on air conditioning during summer months when temperatures regularly reach the 80s and 90s.</p>

<p>Energy efficiency is particularly crucial in Long Beach due to Southern California Edison's (SCE) high electricity rates of 24.2¢/kWh. With cooling costs representing 60-70% of summer electric bills, choosing the right HVAC system can mean the difference between manageable and overwhelming utility expenses. The Mediterranean climate's predictable patterns allow homeowners to invest in systems optimized for cooling efficiency, as heating needs are minimal compared to other regions. Smart system selection and proper sizing can reduce annual energy costs by \$800-1,200 compared to older, inefficient units.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Long Beach Climate</h2>
<p>For Long Beach's Mediterranean climate, high-efficiency air conditioning systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher provide optimal performance. The mild winters make heat pumps an excellent choice, offering efficient cooling in summer and adequate heating during the few cold months. Systems with variable-speed compressors excel in Long Beach's moderate climate, adjusting output to match demand and maintaining consistent indoor comfort while maximizing energy savings. Given the coastal humidity, look for units with enhanced dehumidification features to maintain indoor air quality. Single-stage systems work adequately, but two-stage or variable-speed systems provide superior comfort and efficiency in Long Beach's climate patterns. Most homes benefit from central air systems, though mini-split heat pumps offer excellent zone control for Long Beach's indoor-outdoor lifestyle.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Long Beach</h2>
<p>Long Beach residents can access substantial HVAC rebates through multiple programs. Federal tax credits offer 30% of installation costs (up to \$2,000) for qualifying heat pumps through 2032, while high-efficiency central air conditioners qualify for credits up to \$600. California's Energy Commission provides additional state rebates ranging from \$500-2,000 for ENERGY STAR certified systems. SCE customers receive some of the state's best utility rebates, including \$1,500-3,000 for qualifying heat pump installations and \$500-1,200 for high-efficiency air conditioners. SCE also offers \$75-150 rebates for smart thermostats and up to \$400 for duct sealing services. The California Air Resources Board provides additional incentives through the Self-Generation Incentive Program for battery storage paired with HVAC systems. Combined, these programs can reduce HVAC installation costs by \$2,500-6,000 for Long Beach homeowners who choose qualifying high-efficiency systems.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Long Beach</h2>
<p>Selecting a qualified HVAC contractor in Long Beach requires verifying proper California licensing (C-20 for HVAC work) and Los Angeles County business permits. Look for contractors with extensive experience in Mediterranean climates who understand the unique challenges of coastal installations, including corrosion resistance and humidity control. Quality contractors provide detailed Manual J load calculations to properly size systems for Long Beach's climate and your home's specific needs. Verify they're SCE-approved contractors to ensure rebate eligibility and proper installation standards. Request references from recent Long Beach installations and check Better Business Bureau ratings. Essential services should include 24/7 emergency repair, comprehensive warranties (10+ years on equipment, 2+ years on labor), and maintenance agreements. Avoid contractors who quote without home visits or push unnecessary upgrades. The best Long Beach HVAC contractors offer financing options, understand local permit requirements, and provide detailed written estimates with energy savings projections based on SCE's rate structure.</p>
