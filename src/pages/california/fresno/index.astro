const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Fresno, California</h2>
<p>Fresno's hot-dry climate and abundant sunshine make it one of California's premier locations for solar energy systems. With over 270 sunny days per year and intense summer heat that regularly exceeds 100°F, Fresno homeowners face some of the highest cooling costs in the state. PG&E's electricity rates of 18.5¢/kWh, combined with tiered pricing that penalizes heavy usage, mean that typical Fresno households spend \$150-250 monthly on electricity during peak summer months when air conditioning systems run continuously.</p>

<p>The combination of high solar irradiance and expensive electricity creates an ideal environment for both solar panel installations and energy-efficient HVAC upgrades. Fresno's location in the Central Valley provides consistent solar exposure throughout the year, while the dry climate reduces humidity-related HVAC challenges. For the city's 542,107 residents, investing in solar and modern HVAC systems isn't just environmentally responsible—it's a financial necessity for managing energy costs in one of California's hottest metropolitan areas.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in Fresno average \$3.00 per watt installed, slightly below the California average due to competitive local markets and lower permitting costs compared to coastal cities. The typical 1,680 square foot Fresno home requires a 6-8kW system to offset summer air conditioning loads. With Fresno's excellent solar conditions producing 1,580 kWh per kW installed annually, most homeowners see payback periods of 6-8 years. PG&E's net metering program allows excess solar production to offset evening and winter usage, though recent changes to NEM 3.0 have reduced compensation rates for new installations.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Fresno</h2>
<p>Fresno's hot-dry climate demands robust cooling systems capable of handling extreme summer temperatures while operating efficiently during the city's mild winters. Central air conditioning systems with minimum 16 SEER ratings are recommended, though 18+ SEER units provide better long-term savings given Fresno's high cooling loads. Heat pumps work exceptionally well in Fresno's climate, providing efficient cooling in summer and adequate heating during the region's brief, mild winter season when temperatures rarely drop below 40°F.</p>

<p>Variable-speed systems offer significant advantages in Fresno, where temperature swings between day and night can exceed 30°F even in summer. These systems adjust output to match changing conditions, maintaining consistent comfort while reducing energy consumption. Proper sizing is critical—oversized units short-cycle and waste energy, while undersized systems struggle during 100°F+ days. For typical 1,680 square foot Fresno homes, 3-4 ton units are standard, though factors like insulation, window orientation, and solar heat gain affect sizing requirements. Ductwork inspection and sealing is particularly important in Fresno's older neighborhoods, where leaky ducts can increase cooling costs by 20-40%.</p>

<h2>Fresno Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Fresno homeowners can access substantial incentives for both solar and HVAC upgrades. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit provides a 30% tax credit on solar installations through 2032, reducing to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. For a typical \$18,000 solar system, this represents \$5,400 in savings. California's Self-Generation Incentive Program offers additional rebates for battery storage systems, particularly valuable in Fresno where PG&E implements Public Safety Power Shutoffs during high fire-risk periods.</p>

<p>PG&E offers several energy efficiency rebates relevant to Fresno customers. The Energy Efficiency Customer Rebates program provides up to \$3,000 for high-efficiency HVAC installations, while the Whole House program offers comprehensive incentives for combined upgrades including insulation, windows, and HVAC systems. Fresno County residents can also access Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing through programs like CaliforniaFIRST, allowing solar and HVAC improvements to be financed through property tax assessments with terms up to 30 years. Low-income residents may qualify for additional assistance through California's Energy Savings Assistance Program, which provides free weatherization and HVAC upgrades.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Fresno</h2>
<p>Fresno's diverse neighborhoods present varying opportunities for solar and HVAC installations. The affluent neighborhoods of Fig Garden and Old Fig Garden feature larger homes with substantial roof space ideal for solar installations, though mature tree coverage may require careful panel placement. These areas often have newer HVAC systems but can benefit from upgrades to variable-speed units for improved comfort and efficiency.</p>

<p>Northeast Fresno neighborhoods like Woodward Park and Copper River Ranch represent prime solar territory with newer construction, optimal roof orientations, and homeowners motivated by high electricity bills. The area's 2,000+ square foot homes typically require 8-10kW solar systems and 4-5 ton HVAC units. Central Fresno's historic neighborhoods like Tower District offer solar potential despite smaller lot sizes, though older electrical systems may require updates. Southwest Fresno areas present opportunities for solar paired with HVAC upgrades in older homes where improved efficiency can dramatically reduce energy costs. Each neighborhood's specific characteristics—from roof age and orientation to electrical infrastructure and homeowner association restrictions—influence optimal system design and installation approaches.</p>
