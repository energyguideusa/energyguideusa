const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in San Francisco</h2>
<p>San Francisco's Mediterranean climate makes it an excellent location for solar panel installation, despite the city's reputation for fog. With over 260 sunny days per year and mild temperatures year-round, solar systems in San Francisco can generate substantial electricity. The city's residents benefit from consistent solar production throughout the year, with peak generation during the dry summer months when PG&E's electricity rates are highest. San Francisco's commitment to renewable energy and carbon neutrality by 2030 has created a supportive environment for residential solar adoption.</p>

<p>The high electricity rates in San Francisco, averaging 31.8¢/kWh through Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), make solar panels particularly attractive for the city's 873,965 residents. These rates are significantly higher than the national average, meaning homeowners can achieve faster payback periods and greater long-term savings. San Francisco County's progressive energy policies, combined with the city's density and high property values, create ideal conditions for solar investment. Many homeowners find that solar panels not only reduce their monthly utility bills but also increase their property values in San Francisco's competitive real estate market.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in San Francisco</h2>
<p>San Francisco residents have access to multiple solar incentives that significantly reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit on the total system cost, including equipment and installation, through 2032. California offers additional state-level incentives, including the California Solar Initiative and net energy metering through PG&E, which allows homeowners to sell excess electricity back to the grid at retail rates. PG&E also provides rebates and time-of-use rate plans that maximize savings for solar customers. San Francisco's Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing program allows homeowners to finance solar installations through their property taxes, making solar more accessible regardless of upfront costs. The city also offers expedited permitting processes for solar installations, reducing both time and administrative costs.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in San Francisco</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in San Francisco, prioritize companies with proper California Contractors State License Board (CSLB) licensing, specifically C-46 (Solar) classification. Look for installers with extensive experience in San Francisco's unique architectural challenges, including Victorian homes, steep roofs, and urban shading issues. Top-rated companies should offer comprehensive warranties covering equipment (typically 20-25 years for panels), workmanship (minimum 10 years), and performance guarantees. Verify that installers are certified by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) and have strong local references. Given San Francisco's fog and marine climate, choose companies experienced with microinverters or power optimizers to maximize production in partially shaded conditions. Reputable installers will provide detailed shade analysis, multiple financing options, and handle all permitting and PG&E interconnection paperwork.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in San Francisco</h2>
<p>Solar panels in San Francisco typically achieve payback periods of 6-7 years due to the city's high electricity rates of 31.8¢/kWh. A typical 6kW system costing \$14,700 after the federal tax credit can generate annual savings of approximately \$2,290, leading to over \$57,000 in total savings over 25 years. The return on investment is enhanced by San Francisco's net energy metering program, which credits excess solar production at full retail rates. Property value increases of 3-4% are common with solar installations in San Francisco's competitive real estate market. With PG&E's time-of-use rates, solar systems that include battery storage can provide even greater savings by storing solar energy for use during peak rate periods. Over the 25-year warranted life of solar panels, San Francisco homeowners typically see total returns of 300-400% on their initial investment, making solar one of the best long-term home improvements available.</p>
