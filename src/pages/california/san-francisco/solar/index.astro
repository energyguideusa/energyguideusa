const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in San Francisco</h2>
<p>San Francisco's Mediterranean climate makes it an excellent location for solar panel installation, with mild, dry summers and moderate winters providing consistent sunlight throughout the year. The city receives approximately 260 sunny days annually, generating substantial solar energy potential for the 873,965 residents across San Francisco County. With PG&E's current electricity rates at 31.8¢/kWh—among the highest in the nation—homeowners can achieve significant savings by switching to solar power.</p>

<p>The combination of high electricity costs and abundant sunshine creates ideal conditions for solar investment in San Francisco. PG&E's Time-of-Use rates make solar panels particularly valuable, as they generate peak power during expensive daytime hours when utility rates are highest. San Francisco's progressive environmental policies and strong commitment to renewable energy also provide additional support for residential solar installations, making it easier for homeowners to navigate permitting and interconnection processes.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in San Francisco</h2>
<p>San Francisco residents have access to multiple solar incentives that significantly reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit on the total system cost, including equipment and installation, through 2032. California offers additional state-level incentives through the California Solar Initiative and Self-Generation Incentive Program, which can provide cash rebates for battery storage systems. PG&E participates in California's Net Energy Metering (NEM) program, allowing solar customers to receive credits for excess electricity sent back to the grid at retail rates. The city of San Francisco also expedites solar permits and has streamlined its inspection processes, reducing soft costs associated with installation. Property tax exemptions ensure that adding solar panels won't increase your property tax assessment, while the increased home value from solar installation remains tax-free.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in San Francisco</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in San Francisco, prioritize companies with proper California Contractors State License Board (CSLB) certification and specific experience with San Francisco's unique architectural requirements, including Victorian homes and challenging roof configurations. Look for installers who are certified by major panel manufacturers and have extensive experience with PG&E's interconnection requirements. Quality installers should offer comprehensive warranties covering equipment (typically 20-25 years for panels, 10-15 years for inverters) and workmanship (minimum 10 years). Verify that contractors carry proper insurance, provide detailed proposals with system specifications, and offer transparent pricing. Check references from recent San Francisco installations and ensure the company handles all permitting and PG&E interconnection paperwork. Top-tier installers will also provide monitoring systems and ongoing maintenance support to maximize your system's performance over its 25+ year lifespan.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in San Francisco</h2>
<p>Solar panel installations in San Francisco typically achieve payback periods of 6-7 years due to the city's high electricity rates of 31.8¢/kWh. A typical 6kW system costing \$14,700 after the federal tax credit will generate approximately \$2,290 in annual savings, resulting in a 6.4-year payback period. Over 25 years, homeowners can expect total savings of \$40,000-\$60,000, depending on system size and energy usage patterns. The return on investment becomes even more attractive when considering PG&E's historical rate increases of 3-5% annually, while solar production costs remain fixed. With San Francisco's strong real estate market, solar installations typically add \$15,000-\$20,000 to home values, providing immediate equity benefits. The combination of high utility rates, abundant sunshine, generous incentives, and increasing property values makes San Francisco one of the most financially attractive markets for residential solar investment in California.</p>
