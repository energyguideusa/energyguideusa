const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in San Francisco, California</h2>
<p>San Francisco's Mediterranean climate and high electricity rates make it an excellent location for solar panel installation and efficient HVAC systems. With PG&E charging 31.8¢ per kilowatt-hour—one of the highest rates in the nation—homeowners in this city of 873,965 residents can achieve substantial savings by investing in solar energy. The city's mild, dry summers and cool, wet winters create ideal conditions for solar panel efficiency, while the moderate temperatures reduce the extreme heating and cooling demands found in other climates.</p>

<p>The combination of San Francisco's fog-free afternoons, abundant sunshine during peak demand hours, and the city's commitment to renewable energy initiatives creates a perfect storm for solar adoption. PG&E's net metering program allows residents to sell excess solar power back to the grid, maximizing the return on investment. For HVAC systems, the Mediterranean climate means residents can often rely on natural cooling and moderate heating, making high-efficiency heat pumps and smart thermostats particularly cost-effective in the city's average 1,450 square foot homes.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in San Francisco reflect the city's premium market conditions but offer exceptional returns due to high electricity rates. Installation costs average \$3.50 per watt, slightly higher than the national average due to permitting requirements and labor costs. However, with PG&E's 31.8¢/kWh rate, payback periods typically range from 6-8 years. The city's average solar irradiance of 5.4 peak sun hours per day ensures optimal system performance, particularly for south-facing rooftops common in neighborhoods like Noe Valley and the Mission District.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for San Francisco</h2>
<p>San Francisco's Mediterranean climate requires HVAC systems designed for moderate temperature variations rather than extreme heating or cooling demands. Heat pumps with SEER ratings of 16-20 are ideal for the city's mild conditions, providing both heating and cooling efficiently. Mini-split systems work exceptionally well in San Francisco's Victorian and Edwardian homes, offering zone control without requiring extensive ductwork modifications. The city's average temperature range of 50-70°F means residents can often rely on natural ventilation during shoulder seasons.</p>

<p>For optimal comfort and efficiency, San Francisco homeowners should consider variable-speed heat pumps that can adjust output based on demand. This is particularly important given the city's microclimates—homes in the foggy Sunset District have different needs than those in the sunnier Mission. Smart thermostats paired with these systems can reduce energy consumption by 10-15%, crucial given PG&E's high rates. Proper insulation and air sealing are especially important in older San Francisco homes to maximize HVAC efficiency.</p>

<h2>San Francisco Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>San Francisco residents have access to multiple layers of solar and energy efficiency incentives. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit provides a 30% credit on total system costs through 2032, then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. California's Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) offers rebates for battery storage systems, with additional funding for disadvantaged communities and those affected by Public Safety Power Shutoffs.</p>

<p>PG&E provides several rebate programs for energy-efficient HVAC systems, including up to \$6,500 for qualifying heat pump installations through their Energy Efficiency programs. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District offers additional rebates for replacing gas furnaces with electric heat pumps, supporting the region's electrification goals. San Francisco's Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing allows homeowners to finance solar and efficiency improvements through property tax assessments, with no money down and terms up to 25 years.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in San Francisco</h2>
<p>Different San Francisco neighborhoods present unique opportunities and challenges for solar and HVAC installations. The Mission District and Castro receive the most sunshine, making them prime locations for solar panels, while their older Victorian homes often benefit from ductless mini-split systems. Pacific Heights and Russian Hill feature larger homes with existing ductwork, making central heat pump systems more viable, though fog exposure can slightly reduce solar production.</p>

<p>The Sunset and Richmond districts experience more fog, which can impact solar production in the mornings but still achieve excellent annual yields due to strong afternoon sun. These neighborhoods' post-war homes often have better insulation, reducing HVAC loads. SOMA and the Financial District's newer construction and high-rise buildings present opportunities for larger commercial solar installations and advanced HVAC controls. Noe Valley and Glen Park's mix of home sizes and orientations make customized solar and HVAC solutions particularly important for maximizing efficiency and savings.</p>

<h2>FAQs for San Francisco</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in San Francisco?</h3><p>Solar panels in San Francisco cost between \$3.25-\$3.75 per watt installed, with typical residential systems ranging from \$17,500 for 5kW to \$35,000 for 10kW before incentives. After the 30% federal tax credit, costs drop to \$12,250-\$24,500. Given PG&E's 31.8¢/kWh rates, most systems pay for themselves within 6-8 years and can save homeowners \$2,000-\$4,000 annually.</p></div>
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Best HVAC for San Francisco climate?</h3><p>Heat pumps with 16-20 SEER ratings are ideal for San Francisco's Mediterranean climate. Mini-split systems work exceptionally well in older homes, providing efficient zone control without major ductwork modifications. Variable-speed models that can adjust to the city's mild temperature swings offer the best comfort and efficiency, especially when paired with smart thermostats.</p></div>
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does PG&E offer solar rebates?</h3><p>While PG&E no longer offers direct solar rebates, they provide net metering that credits excess solar production at retail rates. PG&E does offer substantial rebates for energy-efficient HVAC systems, up to \$6,500 for qualifying heat pumps. They also participate in California's SGIP program, offering battery storage rebates that pair well with solar installations.</p></div>
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How does San Francisco's fog affect solar panels?</h3><p>Morning fog typically burns off by noon in most San Francisco neighborhoods, allowing panels to capture peak afternoon sun when electricity rates are highest. While fog can reduce morning production, annual solar yields remain excellent due to California's abundant sunshine. South-facing panels in neighborhoods like the Mission and Castro perform best, while west-facing installations can capture strong late-day sun even in foggier areas.</p></div>
