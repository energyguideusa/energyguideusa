const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in San Francisco, California</h2>
<p>San Francisco's Mediterranean climate makes it an exceptional location for both solar energy and efficient HVAC systems. With over 260 sunny days per year and mild temperatures ranging from 50-70°F, the city provides ideal conditions for solar panel efficiency while reducing extreme heating and cooling demands. The consistent fog patterns that roll in during summer afternoons actually help keep solar panels cool, improving their performance compared to hotter inland areas.</p>

<p>For San Francisco's 873,965 residents served by PG&E, the high electricity rate of 31.8¢/kWh makes solar investment particularly attractive. This rate is significantly above the national average, meaning every kilowatt-hour generated by solar panels provides substantial savings. Combined with the city's commitment to renewable energy and California's supportive solar policies, homeowners in San Francisco County can achieve some of the fastest payback periods for solar installations in the country.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in San Francisco average \$3.50 per watt installed, reflecting the city's competitive solar market and experienced installer base. For the typical San Francisco home size of 1,450 square feet, a 6-7kW system usually provides optimal energy offset. The payback period averages 6-8 years given PG&E's high electricity rates, making solar one of the best home investments available to San Francisco residents.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for San Francisco</h2>
<p>San Francisco's Mediterranean climate creates unique HVAC requirements that differ significantly from other California regions. The city's mild temperatures mean that many homes can operate efficiently with heat pumps rated at 16+ SEER for cooling and 9+ HSPF for heating. Mini-split systems are particularly popular in San Francisco due to their ability to provide both heating and cooling in the compact spaces typical of city homes, while also offering zone control for the multi-level Victorian and Edwardian homes common throughout the city.</p>

<p>Given San Francisco's minimal extreme weather, homeowners can often choose smaller capacity systems than in other climates. A 1,450 square foot home typically requires only 1.5-2 tons of cooling capacity, compared to 2.5-3 tons in hotter regions. The key consideration is humidity control during the foggy summer months, making systems with good dehumidification capabilities essential. Variable-speed systems work exceptionally well in San Francisco's moderate climate, providing precise temperature control while maximizing efficiency during the mild shoulder seasons that comprise most of the year.</p>

<h2>San Francisco Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>San Francisco residents have access to some of California's most generous solar and energy efficiency incentives. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit provides 30% of total system costs back as a tax credit through 2032, then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. California's Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) offers additional rebates for battery storage systems, with rebates ranging from \$200-\$400 per kWh of storage capacity.</p>

<p>PG&E offers several programs specifically beneficial to San Francisco customers, including net energy metering (NEM 3.0) that allows solar customers to receive credits for excess energy sent back to the grid. The utility also provides rebates for high-efficiency HVAC systems through their Energy Efficiency programs, offering up to \$3,000 for qualifying heat pump installations. San Francisco's Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing allows homeowners to finance solar and efficiency upgrades through their property tax bills, making upgrades accessible even without upfront capital.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in San Francisco</h2>
<p>Different San Francisco neighborhoods present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. Pacific Heights and Presidio Heights homes often feature large roof areas with excellent southern exposure, making them ideal for comprehensive solar installations. However, these neighborhoods' historic Victorian architecture may require specialized mounting systems and historic district approvals. The Mission and Castro districts benefit from more sunshine and less fog than western neighborhoods, improving solar production by 10-15% annually.</p>

<p>Western neighborhoods like the Sunset and Richmond face more fog exposure, which can reduce solar production but also decreases cooling loads significantly. These areas often see the greatest benefit from heat pump systems due to the consistent mild temperatures. SOMA and South Beach's newer construction typically features more efficient building envelopes but may have shading challenges from neighboring high-rises. North Beach and Russian Hill's steep terrain can create unique mounting challenges but often provides excellent southern exposure once properly oriented.</p>

<h2>FAQs for San Francisco</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in San Francisco?</h3><p>Solar panel installations in San Francisco average \$3.50 per watt, meaning a typical 6kW system costs \$21,000 before incentives or \$14,700 after the 30% federal tax credit. With PG&E's 31.8¢/kWh electricity rate, this system saves approximately \$2,287 annually, providing payback in 6-7 years and over \$45,000 in savings over the system's 25-year lifespan.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Best HVAC for San Francisco climate?</h3><p>Heat pumps are ideal for San Francisco's Mediterranean climate, providing efficient heating and cooling in one system. Mini-split heat pumps work exceptionally well, offering zone control perfect for Victorian-era homes and requiring minimal ductwork. Look for systems with 16+ SEER cooling and 9+ HSPF heating ratings, with variable-speed compressors for optimal comfort in the city's mild but variable conditions.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does PG&E offer solar rebates?</h3><p>While PG&E no longer offers direct solar panel rebates, they provide net energy metering (NEM 3.0) that credits customers for excess solar energy sent to the grid. PG&E customers can also access California's SGIP battery rebates and utility-sponsored HVAC efficiency rebates up to \$3,000. The most significant savings come from avoiding PG&E's 31.8¢/kWh electricity charges through solar energy production.</p></div>

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How does San Francisco's fog affect solar panels?</h3><p>San Francisco's famous fog actually benefits solar panel performance in two ways: it keeps panels cooler, improving efficiency, and it primarily occurs during peak afternoon hours when electricity demand is highest. While morning fog can reduce early production, the cooler operating temperatures increase overall daily output. Western neighborhoods see 10-15% less production than eastern areas, but this is offset by reduced cooling costs.</p></div>

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">What permits are needed for solar in San Francisco?</h3><p>San Francisco requires building permits for all solar installations, typically processed within 2-3 weeks for standard residential systems. Properties in historic districts may need additional Planning Department review. The city has streamlined permitting for solar through their online portal, and most residential installations qualify for over-the-counter approval. PG&E interconnection agreements are also required and typically processed within 15 business days.</p></div>
