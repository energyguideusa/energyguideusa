const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in San Francisco</h2>
<p>San Francisco's unique Mediterranean climate presents distinct HVAC challenges for the city's 873,965 residents. With mild, wet winters and cool, dry summers, the typical temperature range of 50-70°F means most homes require minimal air conditioning but benefit from efficient heating systems during the foggy summer months and cooler winter periods. The city's microclimates, from the sunny Mission District to the perpetually foggy Sunset, create varying comfort needs within short distances, making properly sized and zoned HVAC systems essential.</p>

<p>Energy efficiency is particularly crucial in San Francisco County due to PG&E's electricity rates of 31.8¢/kWh, which are significantly above the national average. This high cost makes selecting the right HVAC system a critical financial decision that can impact your utility bills for decades. Heat pumps are especially attractive in San Francisco's moderate climate, as they can provide both heating and cooling efficiently without the extreme temperature demands that challenge these systems in harsher climates.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for San Francisco Climate</h2>
<p>For San Francisco's Mediterranean climate, heat pumps with SEER ratings of 16-20 offer the best year-round efficiency and comfort. Unlike traditional furnaces and air conditioners, heat pumps excel in San Francisco's moderate temperature range, providing heating in winter and cooling during warmer periods with exceptional efficiency. Mini-split ductless systems are particularly well-suited for San Francisco's diverse housing stock, including Victorian homes and modern condos, as they don't require extensive ductwork modifications. For homes that primarily need heating, high-efficiency condensing furnaces with AFUE ratings above 90% paired with evaporative cooling or strategically placed mini-splits can provide excellent comfort while minimizing the cooling costs that are typically minimal in San Francisco's climate.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in San Francisco</h2>
<p>San Francisco residents have access to substantial HVAC rebates that can significantly reduce installation costs. Federal tax credits provide up to \$2,000 for qualifying heat pumps and up to \$600 for high-efficiency air conditioners through 2032. California's TECH Clean California program offers additional rebates of \$3,000-7,000 for heat pump installations, with higher amounts for low-income households. PG&E provides rebates ranging from \$500-2,500 for ENERGY STAR certified systems, with enhanced incentives for customers in disadvantaged communities. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District also offers up to \$3,000 for replacing natural gas heating systems with electric heat pumps. When combined, these programs can reduce total installation costs by \$4,000-12,500, making high-efficiency systems much more affordable for San Francisco homeowners.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in San Francisco</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in San Francisco requires careful attention to local licensing and expertise with the city's unique housing challenges. Ensure your contractor holds a valid California C-20 (HVAC) license and is familiar with San Francisco's building codes and permit requirements. Look for contractors experienced with San Francisco's diverse housing stock, from narrow Victorian homes to high-rise condominiums, as each presents unique installation challenges. Priority should be given to contractors who offer detailed load calculations, understand the city's microclimates, and can recommend zoned systems for multi-level homes. Verify they provide 24/7 emergency service, essential given San Francisco's year-round heating needs, and offer comprehensive warranties of at least 5-10 years on equipment and 2 years on labor. Check references specifically from San Francisco customers and ensure they're knowledgeable about available local rebates and can assist with paperwork to maximize your savings.</p>
