const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Rockford, Illinois</h2>
<p>Rockford, Illinois, with its population of 148,655 residents in Winnebago County, presents an excellent opportunity for homeowners to invest in solar panels and efficient HVAC systems. Despite the cold climate, Rockford receives ample sunlight throughout the year, making solar energy a viable option for reducing electricity costs. With ComEd's current electricity rate of 12.9¢/kWh, homeowners can achieve significant savings by generating their own clean energy, especially during peak summer months when air conditioning demands are high.</p>

<p>The cold Illinois winters make efficient heating systems crucial for Rockford homeowners, while the combination of solar panels and modern HVAC technology can dramatically reduce energy costs year-round. ComEd's net metering program allows solar panel owners to sell excess electricity back to the grid, providing additional financial benefits. With the average home size of 1,750 square feet in Rockford, properly sized solar and HVAC systems can meet most residential energy needs while providing long-term cost savings and increased property values.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in Rockford typically range from \$3.00 to \$3.50 per watt before incentives. For the average 1,750 square foot home in Rockford, a 6kW to 8kW system is usually sufficient to offset 80-100% of electricity usage. The payback period for solar installations in Rockford is typically 8-12 years, after which homeowners enjoy free electricity for the remaining 15-20 years of the system's warranty period.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Rockford</h2>
<p>Rockford's cold climate requires robust heating systems capable of handling winter temperatures that frequently drop below freezing. For optimal efficiency, homeowners should consider high-efficiency furnaces with AFUE ratings of 90% or higher, or heat pump systems designed for cold climates. Air conditioning systems should have SEER ratings of at least 16-18 to maximize efficiency during summer months while keeping electricity costs manageable with ComEd's 12.9¢/kWh rate.</p>

<p>Geothermal heat pumps are particularly effective in Rockford's climate, providing both heating and cooling with exceptional efficiency. While the initial investment is higher, geothermal systems can reduce heating and cooling costs by 30-50% compared to conventional systems. Variable-speed systems are also recommended for Rockford homes, as they adjust output based on demand, maintaining consistent temperatures while reducing energy consumption during mild weather periods.</p>

<h3>Recommended HVAC Systems for Rockford:</h3>
<ul>
<li>High-efficiency gas furnaces (90%+ AFUE) paired with 16+ SEER air conditioners</li>
<li>Cold-climate heat pumps with backup heating for temperatures below 10°F</li>
<li>Geothermal systems for maximum year-round efficiency</li>
<li>Ductless mini-split systems for room-by-room climate control</li>
<li>Smart thermostats to optimize energy usage and integrate with solar systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rockford Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Rockford homeowners have access to several incentives that make solar panels and efficient HVAC systems more affordable. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on the total cost of solar panel installations through 2032, then decreases to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to all system components including panels, inverters, batteries, and installation costs.</p>

<p>Illinois offers additional state-level incentives through the Illinois Solar for All program and the Adjustable Block Program, which provide solar renewable energy credits (SRECs) that can be sold for additional income. ComEd customers may also be eligible for rebates on high-efficiency HVAC equipment through the ComEd Energy Efficiency Program, which offers rebates up to \$1,200 for ENERGY STAR certified heating and cooling systems. The utility also provides rebates for smart thermostats, insulation upgrades, and other energy efficiency improvements that complement solar installations.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Rockford</h2>
<p>Rockford's diverse neighborhoods each present unique opportunities and considerations for solar panels and HVAC systems. The Northwest Rockford area, featuring newer homes and larger lots, is ideal for solar installations due to minimal shading and optimal roof orientations. Homes in this area typically have modern HVAC systems that integrate well with solar power systems.</p>

<p>The Downtown and Near East Side neighborhoods feature many historic homes that may require specialized HVAC solutions and careful solar panel placement to maintain architectural integrity. The Southwest Side, with its mix of residential and commercial properties, offers good solar potential with adequate spacing between buildings. Cherry Valley and Loves Park areas, while technically separate municipalities, share similar characteristics with suburban Rockford and are excellent candidates for both solar panels and high-efficiency HVAC systems due to newer construction and favorable lot layouts.</p>
