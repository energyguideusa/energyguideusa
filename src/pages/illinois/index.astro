const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Illinois presents an excellent opportunity for homeowners looking to invest in solar panels and upgrade their HVAC systems. With an average of 4.2 sun hours per day, the Prairie State receives substantial solar irradiance that makes photovoltaic installations highly effective for energy generation. The state's solar potential is particularly strong in the central and southern regions, where cloud cover is minimal during peak sun hours. Combined with Illinois's relatively high electricity rates averaging 13.0¢ per kilowatt-hour, solar installations can generate significant long-term savings for residential and commercial properties.</p>

<p>ComEd serves as the primary utility provider for northern Illinois, including the Chicago metropolitan area, while Ameren Illinois covers much of central and southern Illinois. Both utilities have implemented net metering programs that allow solar panel owners to sell excess electricity back to the grid, creating additional financial benefits. The state's commitment to renewable energy through the Illinois Power Agency's Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan has created a favorable regulatory environment for solar adoption.</p>

<p>Illinois's continental climate, characterized by hot, humid summers and cold winters, places significant demands on HVAC systems throughout the year. Modern high-efficiency heating and cooling systems can substantially reduce energy consumption while maintaining optimal indoor comfort. When paired with solar panel installations, upgraded HVAC systems create a synergistic effect that maximizes energy independence and minimizes utility costs, making Illinois an ideal state for comprehensive home energy improvements.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in Illinois</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Illinois receives approximately 4.2 peak sun hours daily on average, with significant seasonal variation that ranges from 2.5 hours in December to 6.0 hours in July. The state's solar irradiance levels are comparable to other successful solar markets in the Midwest, with annual solar radiation averaging 1,400-1,500 kWh per square meter. Southern Illinois counties like Union, Johnson, and Pope receive the highest solar irradiance, while northern counties near Wisconsin experience slightly lower but still viable solar conditions.</p>

<p>A typical 1kW solar system in Illinois generates approximately 1,150-1,300 kWh annually, depending on panel orientation, tilt angle, and local weather patterns. South-facing installations with optimal 30-degree tilt angles achieve the highest production levels, while east and west-facing arrays produce roughly 85% of south-facing output. Ground-mounted systems often outperform rooftop installations due to better positioning flexibility and reduced shading issues from nearby structures or vegetation.</p>

<p>Illinois's relatively flat topography and minimal mountainous terrain create consistent solar conditions across most regions, with only minor variations due to proximity to Lake Michigan. The lake effect can create additional cloud cover in northeastern counties during certain seasons, but this impact is generally offset by cooler temperatures that improve photovoltaic panel efficiency. Modern solar panels perform optimally in temperatures between 59-95°F, making Illinois's climate well-suited for year-round solar energy production.</p>
