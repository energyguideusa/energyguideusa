const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Illinois presents exceptional opportunities for both solar panel installations and HVAC system upgrades, making it an ideal state for homeowners looking to reduce energy costs and environmental impact. With an average of 4.2 sun hours per day, the Prairie State receives sufficient solar radiation to generate substantial electricity throughout the year. This solar potential, combined with Illinois's relatively high electricity rates averaging 13.0¢ per kWh, creates favorable conditions for solar investment with strong return potential.</p>

<p>The state's energy landscape is dominated by ComEd (Commonwealth Edison), which serves the majority of northern Illinois including the Chicago metropolitan area, while Ameren Illinois covers much of central and southern Illinois. These utility providers offer net metering programs that allow solar panel owners to sell excess electricity back to the grid, further enhancing the financial benefits of solar installations. Additionally, Illinois's continental climate with hot summers and cold winters creates significant demand for both heating and cooling systems, making efficient HVAC systems crucial for maintaining comfort while controlling energy costs.</p>

<p>Illinois has positioned itself as a leader in clean energy adoption through progressive policies and incentive programs. The Illinois Shines program, coupled with federal tax credits, can reduce the upfront costs of solar installations by 50% or more. For HVAC systems, various utility rebates and federal tax credits for high-efficiency equipment make upgrades more affordable. The combination of favorable solar conditions, supportive policies, and climate-driven energy needs makes Illinois an excellent market for both solar and HVAC investments.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in Illinois</h2>
<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Illinois receives approximately 4.2 peak sun hours per day on average, with seasonal variations ranging from 2.5 hours in winter months to over 6 hours during peak summer periods. This solar irradiance translates to annual production potential of roughly 1,200-1,400 kWh per installed kW of solar capacity. The state's relatively flat terrain and minimal mountainous obstructions provide consistent solar exposure across most regions, though northern areas near Chicago may experience slightly lower production than southern regions near St. Louis.</p>

<p>Modern solar panels perform efficiently even in Illinois's variable weather conditions. High-quality monocrystalline panels can maintain 85-90% of their rated efficiency in temperatures up to 77°F, with gradual decreases in higher temperatures. Illinois's moderate climate actually benefits solar production, as panels operate more efficiently in cooler conditions compared to extremely hot southern states. Snow coverage during winter months provides temporary reductions in production, but panels' dark surfaces and angled installations typically allow for natural snow clearing within 1-2 days of snowfall.</p>

<p>The state's solar resource quality makes residential systems highly viable for offsetting electricity consumption. A typical 8kW residential system in Illinois can generate 9,600-11,200 kWh annually, which covers 80-100% of average household electricity usage. Commercial and utility-scale installations benefit from economies of scale and can achieve even better production ratios. Illinois's position in the Midwest also provides consistent year-round production without the extreme seasonal variations seen in northern border states.</p>

<p>HVAC system costs in Illinois vary significantly based on system type, home size, and installation complexity. High-efficiency systems command premium pricing but offer substantial long-term savings through reduced energy consumption. Installation costs include equipment, labor, ductwork modifications when necessary, electrical connections, and permits. Chicago-area installations typically cost 15-20% more than rural locations due to higher labor costs and more complex permitting requirements.</p>

<p>Energy savings calculations are based on replacing 10-15 year old systems with modern high-efficiency equipment. Actual savings depend on home size, insulation quality, usage patterns, and utility rates. ComEd and Ameren Illinois both offer rebates for qualifying high-efficiency equipment, which can reduce upfront costs by \$500-2,000 depending on system type and efficiency ratings. These utility incentives are factored into the payback period calculations.</p>
