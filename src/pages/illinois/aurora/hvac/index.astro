const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora, Illinois residents face unique HVAC challenges due to the city's cold continental climate, where winter temperatures regularly drop below freezing and summers can reach the upper 80s. With a population of 180,542 across Kane County, Aurora homeowners need robust heating systems that can handle harsh winters while maintaining energy efficiency. The cold climate means heating costs dominate annual energy bills, making system efficiency crucial for managing expenses with ComEd's electricity rate of 13.4¢/kWh.</p>

<p>The extended heating season in Aurora, typically running from October through April, places significant demands on HVAC systems. Residents should prioritize high-efficiency heating solutions like heat pumps with backup systems or high-efficiency gas furnaces paired with efficient cooling systems. With energy costs at 13.4¢/kWh through ComEd, upgrading to efficient HVAC systems can result in substantial savings, especially during peak winter months when heating demands are highest. Modern systems with proper sizing and installation can reduce energy consumption by 20-40% compared to older, inefficient units.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Aurora Climate</h2>
<p>For Aurora's cold climate, dual-fuel heat pump systems offer the best year-round efficiency, switching between electric heat pump operation in mild weather and gas furnace backup when temperatures drop below 25°F. Look for heat pumps with HSPF ratings of 9.0 or higher and SEER ratings of at least 16. Traditional gas furnaces should have AFUE ratings of 90% or higher to maximize heating efficiency during Aurora's long winters. For cooling, 16-18 SEER air conditioning systems provide adequate efficiency for the moderate summer cooling demands, though higher SEER ratings offer better humidity control and comfort. Given that heating represents 60-70% of annual HVAC energy use in Aurora, investing in high-efficiency heating equipment provides the greatest return on investment.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora residents can access multiple rebate programs to offset HVAC installation costs. Federal tax credits provide up to \$2,000 for heat pumps and 30% of costs for geothermal systems through 2032. Illinois offers additional rebates through the Future Energy Jobs Act, providing up to \$1,200 for high-efficiency heat pumps and \$800 for ENERGY STAR certified furnaces. ComEd customers can receive rebates of \$300-600 for qualifying heat pumps and \$100-300 for high-efficiency air conditioners through their Energy Efficiency Program. Additionally, ComEd offers smart thermostat rebates of \$75-100 and ductless mini-split rebates up to \$400 per indoor unit. Many Aurora residents can combine these programs to save \$1,500-3,000 on qualifying HVAC upgrades, significantly reducing payback periods.</p>
