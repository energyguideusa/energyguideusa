const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora, Illinois residents face unique HVAC challenges due to the city's cold continental climate, where winter temperatures regularly drop below freezing and summers can reach the upper 80s. With a population of 180,542 spread across Kane County, Aurora homeowners need robust heating systems that can handle months of sub-zero temperatures while maintaining energy efficiency. The city's location in northern Illinois means HVAC systems must prioritize heating capacity over cooling, with furnaces and heat pumps working overtime from November through March.</p>

<p>Energy costs play a significant role in HVAC decision-making for Aurora residents, with ComEd supplying electricity at 13.4¢ per kWh. This rate makes energy-efficient systems particularly attractive, as heating costs can account for 50-70% of winter utility bills in cold climates. High-efficiency furnaces, heat pumps, and smart thermostats become essential investments for managing the substantial energy demands of keeping homes comfortable during Aurora's harsh winters, where heating degree days often exceed 6,500 annually.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Aurora Climate</h2>
<p>For Aurora's cold climate, dual-fuel systems combining gas furnaces with electric heat pumps offer optimal efficiency and reliability. Heat pumps should have cold-climate ratings effective down to -15°F, with backup gas heating for extreme temperatures. Look for heat pumps with HSPF ratings of 9.0 or higher and gas furnaces with AFUE ratings of 90% or above. While cooling needs are moderate, 16 SEER air conditioning units provide adequate efficiency for Aurora's summers without over-investing in cooling capacity. The heating season dominates energy usage, making high-efficiency furnaces with variable-speed blowers and smart thermostats the priority investments for year-round comfort and energy savings.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora residents can access substantial savings through multiple rebate programs when upgrading HVAC systems. Federal tax credits offer up to \$2,000 for heat pumps and \$600 for high-efficiency air conditioners meeting ENERGY STAR requirements. Illinois residents benefit from the state's energy efficiency programs, including rebates up to \$1,500 for qualifying heat pump installations. ComEd provides additional rebates through their Energy Efficiency Program, offering \$500-1,200 for ENERGY STAR certified systems, smart thermostats rebates of \$100, and tune-up incentives of \$100. These combined incentives can reduce total installation costs by \$2,000-4,000, making high-efficiency systems more accessible for Aurora homeowners while supporting long-term energy savings.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Aurora</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in Aurora requires careful attention to local licensing requirements and cold-climate expertise. Ensure contractors hold valid Illinois contractor licenses and EPA certifications for refrigerant handling. Look for established companies with specific experience in Aurora's climate challenges, including knowledge of local building codes and winterization requirements. Quality contractors should provide detailed written estimates, offer comprehensive warranties of 5-10 years on installations, and guarantee 24/7 emergency service during winter months. Check Better Business Bureau ratings, Google reviews, and ask for local references from recent customers. Avoid door-to-door sales tactics and unusually low bids, which often indicate substandard equipment or installation practices that can be costly in Aurora's demanding climate conditions.</p>
