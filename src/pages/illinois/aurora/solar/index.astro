const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora, Illinois homeowners are increasingly turning to solar energy despite the city's cold climate conditions. With a population of 180,542 residents in Kane County, Aurora presents unique opportunities for solar adoption, particularly given ComEd's electricity rates of 13.4¢/kWh. While Illinois experiences harsh winters with snow and ice, modern solar panels are designed to perform efficiently in cold temperatures and can actually operate more effectively in cooler weather than in extreme heat.</p>

<p>The key to successful solar installation in Aurora lies in proper system design that accounts for seasonal variations and snow load requirements. Professional installers familiar with Illinois building codes ensure panels are mounted at optimal angles for both energy production and snow shedding. ComEd's net metering program allows Aurora residents to sell excess power back to the grid during sunny periods, offsetting consumption during cloudier winter months. This arrangement makes solar financially viable even in Aurora's variable climate conditions.</p>

Illinois offers the Adjustable Block Program through the Illinois Power Agency, providing Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) that can be sold for additional income over 15 years. ComEd customers benefit from net metering, allowing excess energy to be credited at retail rates. Additionally, Kane County and Aurora may offer property tax exemptions for solar installations, and many local banks provide specialized solar financing options with competitive rates for Aurora residents.</p>

Reputable Aurora solar companies should provide detailed site assessments, custom system designs accounting for local weather patterns, and transparent pricing with no high-pressure sales tactics. Verify their Better Business Bureau ratings, read local customer reviews, and confirm they handle all permitting, ComEd interconnection applications, and incentive paperwork. Companies familiar with Aurora's specific building codes, snow load requirements, and ComEd's net metering procedures will ensure smoother installations and optimal system performance.</p>
