const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora, Illinois residents are discovering that solar panels can be a smart investment even in the city's cold climate. With a population of 180,542 in Kane County, Aurora homeowners pay an average of 13.4¢ per kilowatt-hour through ComEd, which is above the national average and makes solar energy particularly attractive for reducing monthly electricity bills. The higher utility rates mean faster payback periods and greater long-term savings for solar installations.</p>

<p>While Aurora experiences cold winters, modern solar panels actually perform more efficiently in cooler temperatures and can generate substantial energy year-round. Snow typically slides off angled solar panels or melts quickly, and the long summer days with abundant sunshine more than compensate for reduced winter production. ComEd's net metering program allows Aurora residents to sell excess power back to the grid, earning credits that offset usage during less sunny periods, making solar a viable year-round energy solution.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora residents can take advantage of multiple solar incentives that significantly reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on the total system cost, including equipment and installation, which remains at 30% through 2032. Illinois offers additional state-level programs including the Illinois Solar for All initiative, which provides extra incentives for income-qualified households. The state's Adjustable Block Program also provides Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) that create ongoing income for solar system owners. ComEd participates in Illinois' net metering program, allowing Aurora customers to receive full retail credit for excess solar energy fed back into the grid, effectively running the meter backward during peak production periods. These combined incentives can reduce the total cost of a solar installation by 40-50% or more, making solar energy highly affordable for Aurora homeowners.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Aurora</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in Aurora, prioritize companies with proper Illinois licensing, NABCEP-certified installers, and extensive local experience with ComEd interconnection procedures. Look for installers who offer comprehensive warranties covering equipment (typically 20-25 years for panels, 10-15 years for inverters) and workmanship (minimum 10 years). The best Aurora solar companies will conduct thorough site assessments, provide detailed production estimates based on local weather data, handle all permitting and ComEd paperwork, and offer financing options. Verify that installers carry proper insurance, check Better Business Bureau ratings, and request references from recent Kane County installations. Reputable companies will provide transparent pricing, explain all available incentives, and offer post-installation monitoring and maintenance services to ensure optimal system performance throughout Aurora's varying seasonal conditions.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Aurora</h2>
<p>With electricity rates at 13.4¢ per kWh in Aurora, solar panels typically pay for themselves within 12-14 years while providing 25+ years of energy production. A typical 6kW system costing \$12,600 after the federal tax credit can save Aurora homeowners approximately \$965 annually, leading to total 25-year savings of over \$24,000. These calculations account for Illinois' solar production levels and factor in modest annual electricity rate increases from ComEd. The return on investment becomes even more attractive when considering that solar panels increase property values by approximately 4% while being exempt from property tax increases under Illinois law. Aurora's combination of above-average electricity rates, strong solar incentives, and ComEd's favorable net metering policies creates an ideal environment for solar ROI, with many homeowners seeing 8-10% annual returns on their solar investment.</p>

<h2>Climate Considerations for Aurora Solar</h2>
<p>Aurora's cold climate actually benefits solar panel performance in several ways. Solar panels operate more efficiently in cooler temperatures, often producing higher output per panel in winter months compared to extremely hot climates. While snow can temporarily cover panels, Aurora's average snowfall and winter sun angles typically result in natural snow removal within days. The city receives approximately 190 sunny days per year, with peak production occurring during long summer days when air conditioning demands are highest.</p>

<p>Aurora solar installations should account for potential ice loading and wind loads common in northern Illinois. Quality installers use appropriate racking systems and ensure adequate roof structural support. Panel orientation and tilt angles are optimized for Aurora's latitude (41.7°N) to maximize year-round production. Ground-mount systems are popular alternatives for properties with limited suitable roof space or those wanting easier snow removal access during heavy winter storms.</p>
