const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Aurora, Illinois</h2>
<p>Aurora, Illinois presents excellent opportunities for both solar panel installations and efficient HVAC systems. With a population of 180,542 residents in Kane County, Aurora homeowners face electricity rates of 13.4¢ per kWh through ComEd, making solar energy an increasingly attractive investment. The city's cold climate creates substantial heating demands during winter months, while summers still require adequate cooling, making energy-efficient HVAC systems essential for managing utility costs.</p>

<p>Aurora's geographic location provides approximately 4.2 peak sun hours daily on average, which is sufficient for solar panels to generate meaningful savings against ComEd's rates. The cold climate means homeowners typically see higher electricity bills during winter months for heating, and solar panels can offset a significant portion of annual energy consumption. With average home sizes of 1,920 square feet, most Aurora residents can benefit from properly sized solar and HVAC systems that work together to maximize energy efficiency and cost savings.</p>

<p>For Aurora's average 1,920 square foot homes, a 6-8kW solar system typically provides optimal coverage for annual electricity needs. The payback period ranges from 9-12 years, considering Aurora's solar irradiance levels and ComEd's current rates. Installation costs vary based on roof complexity, panel quality, and installer selection, but Aurora homeowners can expect competitive pricing due to the city's growing solar market.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora's cold climate demands robust heating systems capable of handling winter temperatures that frequently drop below freezing. Heat pumps with cold-climate capabilities or hybrid systems combining heat pumps with gas furnaces provide excellent efficiency for Aurora homes. For cooling needs, SEER ratings of 14-16 are typically sufficient, as Aurora doesn't experience extreme summer heat like southern regions. However, investing in higher SEER ratings (18+) can provide additional savings when paired with solar panels.</p>

<p>Gas furnaces remain popular in Aurora due to reliable performance in extreme cold, with AFUE ratings of 90% or higher recommended for optimal efficiency. Ductless mini-split systems work well for home additions or areas with specific heating and cooling needs. Given Aurora's climate, proper insulation and air sealing are crucial for HVAC efficiency, and many homeowners find that upgrading both simultaneously with solar installation maximizes overall energy savings.</p>

<h3>Recommended HVAC Options for Aurora:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cold-climate heat pumps (rated for -15°F or lower)</li>
<li>High-efficiency gas furnaces (90+ AFUE)</li>
<li>Hybrid heat pump/furnace systems</li>
<li>Variable-speed air handlers for improved comfort</li>
<li>Smart thermostats for optimal energy management</li>
</ul>

<h2>Aurora Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Aurora residents can take advantage of several energy incentives that make solar and HVAC upgrades more affordable. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit for solar panel installations through 2032, representing substantial savings on system costs. Illinois also offers the Adjustable Block Program through ComEd, providing Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) that create additional income streams for solar system owners.</p>

<p>ComEd offers various rebates for energy-efficient HVAC equipment, including rebates for high-efficiency furnaces, heat pumps, and smart thermostats. The utility's Energy Efficiency Program provides rebates ranging from \$50-\$1,200 depending on equipment type and efficiency ratings. Additionally, Aurora participates in Illinois's net metering program, allowing solar system owners to receive credit for excess electricity sent back to the grid at retail rates.</p>

<p>Property tax exemptions for solar installations mean that adding solar panels won't increase property taxes, despite increasing home value. Low-interest financing options through various state and local programs make it easier for Aurora homeowners to invest in both solar and HVAC upgrades simultaneously, maximizing energy savings and comfort improvements.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. The historic downtown area features older homes that may require electrical upgrades before solar installation, but these properties often benefit significantly from modern HVAC systems replacing outdated equipment. The Foxfield and Springbrook neighborhoods feature newer construction with better solar orientation and modern electrical systems that accommodate solar installations more easily.</p>

<p>West Aurora neighborhoods like Prairie Crossing and Montgomery Circle feature larger homes that benefit from zoned HVAC systems and larger solar installations. These areas typically have fewer shading issues and optimal roof orientations for solar panel placement. East Aurora's established neighborhoods often feature mature trees that may require careful solar system design to maximize production while preserving landscaping.</p>

<p>The Far East Side and Indian Trail areas represent Aurora's newer developments, where homes are often pre-wired for solar and feature more efficient HVAC systems. However, homeowners in these areas should consider solar early to lock in current incentives and net metering rates. Each neighborhood's specific utility infrastructure and ComEd service characteristics can influence solar interconnection processes and timing.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Aurora</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in Aurora?</h3><p>Solar panel costs in Aurora range from \$15,000-\$35,000 before incentives, depending on system size. After the 30% federal tax credit, homeowners typically pay \$10,500-\$24,500.

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Best HVAC for Aurora climate?</h3><p>For Aurora's cold climate, high-efficiency gas furnaces (90+ AFUE) or cold-climate heat pumps rated for -15°F operation work best. Hybrid systems combining heat pumps with gas backup provide optimal efficiency and reliability. Air conditioning should have SEER ratings of 14-16 minimum, though higher ratings provide better savings when paired with solar panels.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does ComEd offer solar rebates?</h3><p>ComEd doesn't offer direct solar rebates, but participates in Illinois's Adjustable Block Program, providing Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) that create ongoing income for solar system owners. ComEd also offers net metering, crediting excess solar production at retail rates. They do provide rebates for energy-efficient HVAC equipment ranging from \$50-\$1,200.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How long do solar panels last in Aurora's climate?</h3><p>Quality solar panels typically last 25-30 years in Aurora's climate. Cold temperatures actually help panel efficiency, though snow cover can temporarily reduce production. Most manufacturers provide 20-25 year warranties, and systems often continue producing electricity beyond warranty periods at slightly reduced capacity.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Can I run my HVAC system on solar power in Aurora?</h3><p>Yes, properly sized solar systems can power HVAC equipment in Aurora. An 8-10kW solar system typically covers most residential HVAC energy needs along with other household consumption. Battery storage can provide backup power during outages, though grid-tied systems without batteries won't operate during ComEd power outages for safety reasons.</p></div>
