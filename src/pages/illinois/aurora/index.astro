const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Aurora, Illinois</h2>
<p>Aurora, Illinois, with its population of 180,542 residents in Kane County, presents excellent opportunities for homeowners to reduce energy costs through solar panel installations and efficient HVAC systems. Despite the cold climate, Aurora receives substantial sunlight throughout the year, making solar panels a viable investment that can significantly offset the city's electricity costs served by ComEd at 13.4¢ per kWh. This rate is higher than the national average, creating even greater potential savings for Aurora residents who switch to solar energy.</p>

<p>The combination of Aurora's cold winters and warm summers means HVAC systems work year-round, driving up energy bills for the city's typical 1,920 square foot homes. By pairing high-efficiency HVAC systems with solar panels, Aurora homeowners can dramatically reduce their energy dependence on ComEd's grid while maintaining comfortable indoor temperatures throughout Illinois's variable climate. The city's suburban layout and mix of older and newer homes provide ideal roof space and orientation for solar installations, while modern HVAC technology can handle the demanding temperature swings common in northern Illinois.</p>

<p>For Aurora's average 1,920 square foot homes, a 6-8kW solar system typically provides optimal coverage for annual electricity needs. With ComEd's rate of 13.4¢ per kWh, most Aurora homeowners see payback periods of 8-12 years, followed by decades of free electricity. The city's location in northern Illinois provides approximately 4.2 peak sun hours daily on average, with seasonal variations that still make solar highly profitable year-round.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora's cold climate demands robust HVAC systems capable of handling winter temperatures that frequently drop below freezing while providing efficient cooling during humid summer months. For this climate zone, heat pumps with backup heating systems or high-efficiency gas furnaces paired with central air conditioning work best. Recommended SEER ratings for Aurora should be at least 16-18 for air conditioning units, while heating systems should achieve AFUE ratings of 90% or higher to maximize efficiency during the extended heating season.</p>

<p>Due to Aurora's temperature extremes, dual-fuel systems combining electric heat pumps with gas furnace backup provide excellent efficiency and reliability. These systems use the heat pump during milder weather and automatically switch to gas heating when outdoor temperatures drop below the heat pump's effective range. For the city's 1,920 square foot average home size, properly sized systems typically range from 2.5 to 4-ton capacity, depending on insulation levels, window efficiency, and home orientation. Smart thermostats with zoning capabilities can further optimize energy usage, especially important when paired with solar panel systems to maximize self-consumption of generated electricity.</p>

<h2>Aurora Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Aurora residents have access to multiple incentive programs that significantly reduce the cost of solar and HVAC installations. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on total solar installation costs through 2032, then decreasing to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the entire system cost, including equipment, installation, and permits, making it one of the most valuable solar incentives available to Aurora homeowners.</p>

<p>Illinois offers additional state-level incentives through the Illinois Shines program, which provides Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) that can be sold back to utilities, generating ongoing income for solar system owners. ComEd also participates in energy efficiency rebate programs for high-efficiency HVAC equipment, offering rebates up to \$1,200 for qualifying heat pumps, air conditioners, and smart thermostats. The combination of federal, state, and utility incentives can reduce the total cost of solar and HVAC upgrades by 40-50% for Aurora residents, making these investments increasingly attractive for homeowners looking to reduce long-term energy costs.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora's diverse neighborhoods each present unique opportunities for solar and HVAC installations. The historic downtown area and surrounding older neighborhoods like Stolp Island feature charming older homes that may require HVAC upgrades to improve efficiency, though roof conditions and orientations vary for solar suitability. The Foxfield subdivision and other newer developments on Aurora's west side typically have ideal roof orientations and newer electrical systems that easily accommodate solar installations, while modern HVAC systems may only need minor efficiency upgrades.</p>

<p>Neighborhoods like Indian Trail and Montgomery Road areas feature larger lots and homes that often benefit from larger solar systems and zoned HVAC systems due to their size. The established neighborhoods around Aurora University and near the Fox River offer a mix of home styles and ages, requiring customized approaches to both solar and HVAC solutions. Eastern Aurora neighborhoods closer to Naperville often have higher property values and energy-conscious homeowners who particularly benefit from premium solar and HVAC systems that add significant home value while reducing utility costs.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Aurora</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in Aurora?</h3><p>Solar panel costs in Aurora typically range from \$15,000-\$35,000 before incentives, depending on system size. After the 30% federal tax credit, costs drop to \$10,500-\$24,500.

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Best HVAC for Aurora climate?</h3><p>Aurora's cold climate requires heating systems rated for sub-zero temperatures. Dual-fuel systems combining electric heat pumps with gas furnace backup work exceptionally well, providing efficiency in mild weather and reliability during harsh winters. High-efficiency gas furnaces (90%+ AFUE) with 16+ SEER air conditioning also perform excellently. Proper sizing for 1,920 square foot homes typically requires 2.5-4 ton systems with smart thermostats for optimal performance.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does ComEd offer solar rebates?</h3><p>ComEd doesn't offer direct solar rebates, but Aurora residents benefit from Illinois Shines program SRECs (Solar Renewable Energy Credits) that provide ongoing payments for solar production. ComEd does offer rebates up to \$1,200 for high-efficiency HVAC equipment including heat pumps, central air conditioners, and smart thermostats. These utility rebates combine with federal and state incentives to significantly reduce total system costs.</p></div>

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How long is payback period for solar in Aurora?</h3><p>Solar payback periods in Aurora typically range from 8-12 years due to ComEd's 13.4¢/kWh electricity rate and available incentives. After payback, systems continue producing free electricity for 15-20+ additional years. With Illinois Shines SREC payments providing ongoing income and the 30% federal tax credit, many Aurora homeowners see faster payback periods, especially when paired with energy-efficient HVAC systems that reduce overall consumption.</p></div>
