<h2>Solar Panels in Oregon</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Oregon's solar irradiance levels vary significantly by region, with Eastern Oregon receiving 4.5-5.5 peak sun hours daily compared to Western Oregon's 3.8-4.2 hours. The Willamette Valley, home to most of the state's population, averages 4.1 peak sun hours annually, translating to approximately 1,300-1,500 kWh per installed kW of solar capacity per year. This production level supports strong returns on investment despite the state's cloudy reputation.</p>

<p>Seasonal variations in Oregon create interesting production patterns, with summer months generating 40-50% more electricity than winter months. However, Oregon's mild summers mean that solar panels operate more efficiently due to lower temperatures, while the longer daylight hours during summer partially offset reduced winter production. Snow accumulation is minimal in most populated areas, and Oregon's frequent winter rains help keep panels clean and operating at peak efficiency.</p>

<p>The state's marine influence moderates temperature extremes, creating ideal conditions for photovoltaic systems. Most residential installations in Oregon use monocrystalline or polycrystalline silicon panels rated between 300-400 watts, with typical residential systems ranging from 5kW to 12kW. Ground-mounted systems are popular in rural areas, while urban installations favor roof-mounted arrays with optimal south-facing orientations and minimal shading from Oregon's abundant tree cover.</p>
