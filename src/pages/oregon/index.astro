const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Oregon presents an excellent opportunity for homeowners considering solar panels and HVAC system upgrades, despite common misconceptions about the Pacific Northwest's weather. With an average of 4.2 sun hours per day, Oregon receives more solar irradiance than many people realize, particularly in the eastern regions and during the summer months. The state's moderate climate, combined with relatively high electricity rates averaging 10.8¢ per kilowatt-hour, creates favorable conditions for both solar energy production and efficient HVAC system operation.</p>

<p>Portland General Electric (PGE), serving as the primary utility provider for much of Oregon, offers various programs and net metering policies that support renewable energy adoption. The utility's commitment to clean energy, combined with Oregon's progressive environmental policies, has created a supportive infrastructure for solar installations. Additionally, Oregon's temperate climate requires heating systems that work efficiently in mild winters and cooling systems for increasingly warm summers, making modern HVAC upgrades both practical and cost-effective.</p>

<p>The combination of federal tax incentives, state rebates, and utility programs makes Oregon one of the more attractive states for solar and HVAC investments. Homeowners can take advantage of the 30% federal solar tax credit, state rebates up to \$5,000, and various financing options that significantly reduce upfront costs while providing long-term energy savings.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in Oregon</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Oregon's solar potential varies significantly by region, with eastern Oregon receiving considerably more sunlight than the western coastal areas. The state averages 4.2 peak sun hours per day annually, with locations like Bend and Medford receiving up to 5.5 peak sun hours daily, while Portland and coastal areas average around 3.8 to 4.2 peak sun hours. This solar irradiance is sufficient for substantial electricity generation, particularly when considering that Germany, a global solar leader, averages only 3.0 peak sun hours per day.</p>

<p>Solar panel systems in Oregon typically produce between 1,100 to 1,400 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per installed kilowatt annually, depending on location, panel orientation, and shading conditions. A typical 5kW residential system can generate approximately 5,500 to 7,000 kWh per year, which covers 60-80% of an average Oregon household's electricity consumption. The state's mild temperatures actually benefit solar panel efficiency, as photovoltaic panels perform better in cooler conditions compared to extremely hot climates.</p>

<p>Net metering policies in Oregon allow homeowners to sell excess electricity back to the grid at retail rates, making solar installations even more economically attractive. During sunny summer months, well-designed systems often produce more electricity than homes consume, creating credits that offset usage during cloudier winter periods. This seasonal balancing effect, combined with Oregon's stable weather patterns, provides predictable solar energy production throughout the year.</p>
