const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Gresham, Oregon</h2>
<p>Gresham, Oregon, with its population of 114,247 residents in Multnomah County, presents excellent opportunities for solar panel installation and energy-efficient HVAC systems. The city's marine climate provides moderate temperatures year-round, with mild summers and cool, wet winters that create ideal conditions for solar panel efficiency and reduced HVAC energy demands. With Portland General Electric (PGE) serving the area at electricity rates of 11.2¢ per kWh, Gresham homeowners are paying above the national average, making solar energy investments particularly attractive for long-term savings.</p>

<p>The marine climate in Gresham means solar panels operate more efficiently due to cooler temperatures, which prevent the efficiency losses common in hotter climates. Additionally, the moderate climate reduces extreme heating and cooling needs, allowing homeowners to optimize their HVAC systems for maximum efficiency. The combination of PGE's net metering program and Oregon's favorable solar policies creates a compelling case for Gresham residents to invest in renewable energy solutions for their average 1,720 square foot homes.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in Gresham typically range from \$3.00 to \$3.50 per watt before incentives, making them competitive with regional pricing. The federal tax credit of 30% significantly reduces upfront costs, and with PGE's electricity rate of 11.2¢ per kWh, most systems pay for themselves within 12-15 years. For the average Gresham home of 1,720 square feet, a 6-8kW system usually provides optimal coverage, generating between 7,200-9,600 kWh annually in Oregon's climate conditions.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Gresham</h2>
<p>Gresham's marine climate presents unique HVAC requirements that differ from both hot desert and cold continental climates. The moderate temperature swings mean homeowners need systems that efficiently handle both heating during wet winters (average lows around 35°F) and cooling during dry summers (average highs around 82°F). Heat pumps are particularly well-suited for this climate, offering both heating and cooling capabilities with SEER ratings of 16-20 and HSPF ratings of 9-10 being ideal for the region.</p>

<p>For Gresham homes, ductless mini-split systems work exceptionally well, providing zone-controlled comfort that matches the mild climate's variable needs. Traditional forced-air systems should feature variable-speed motors and smart thermostats to optimize efficiency during the shoulder seasons when neither heating nor cooling is heavily required. Due to the high humidity during winter months, proper ventilation and dehumidification features are essential to maintain indoor air quality and prevent moisture-related issues common in marine climates.</p>

<h2>Gresham Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Gresham residents have access to multiple layers of solar and HVAC incentives that significantly reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on total system costs through 2032, then stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Oregon's Solar + Storage Rebate Program offers additional incentives up to \$5,000 for solar installations paired with battery storage, making energy independence more accessible for Gresham homeowners.</p>

<p>Portland General Electric provides net metering for solar customers, allowing excess energy to be credited at retail rates, and offers cash incentives for high-efficiency HVAC installations through their Energy Efficiency programs. The utility's Smart Grid Test Bed program sometimes includes Gresham in pilot programs for advanced energy management systems. Additionally, Oregon's Residential Energy Tax Credit and the state's Property Tax Exemption for renewable energy systems ensure that solar investments don't increase property tax assessments, maximizing long-term savings for Gresham residents.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Gresham</h2>
<p>Gresham's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. Historic downtown Gresham features older homes that may require electrical upgrades for solar installations but offer excellent south-facing roof orientations. The Powell Valley area, with its newer construction and larger lots, provides ideal conditions for ground-mounted solar systems and modern HVAC installations with proper ductwork.</p>

<p>Rockwood, undergoing revitalization, presents opportunities for energy-efficient upgrades that can significantly improve home values while reducing utility costs. The Centennial neighborhood's mix of ranch-style homes from the 1960s-80s often features ideal roof angles for solar panels but may need HVAC ductwork improvements. East Gresham's hillside locations offer excellent solar exposure but may require specialized mounting systems due to slope considerations. Pleasant Valley's newer developments often come solar-ready with modern electrical panels and efficient HVAC systems already installed.</p>
