const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Eugene, Oregon</h2>
<p>Eugene, Oregon presents an excellent opportunity for homeowners to invest in solar panels and efficient HVAC systems. Despite the Pacific Northwest's reputation for cloudy weather, Eugene's marine climate provides consistent solar irradiance throughout the year, with summer months offering peak production potential. The city's moderate temperatures, ranging from 40-80°F annually, create ideal conditions for solar panel efficiency while reducing the extreme heating and cooling demands that burden homeowners in more volatile climates.</p>

<p>With Eugene Water & Electric Board (EWEB) charging residential customers an average of 10.9¢ per kWh, local homeowners have significant potential for long-term savings through solar installations. EWEB's net metering program allows solar customers to sell excess power back to the grid, creating additional value from residential solar systems. The marine climate also means HVAC systems don't face the extreme temperature swings common in other regions, allowing for more efficient operation and longer equipment lifespans in Eugene's 176,654-resident community.</p>

<p>For Eugene's average 1,750 square foot homes, a 6-8kW solar system typically provides optimal coverage for annual electricity needs. The payback period for solar installations in Eugene averages 12-15 years, with systems lasting 25-30 years, ensuring significant long-term savings for homeowners. Installation costs in Lane County remain competitive due to the region's growing solar market and experienced contractor network.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Eugene</h2>
<p>Eugene's marine climate creates unique HVAC requirements that differ significantly from other regions. The moderate temperature ranges mean homeowners can benefit from high-efficiency heat pump systems, which excel in Eugene's 40-80°F operating range. For cooling needs during Eugene's warm summer months, SEER ratings of 16-20 provide excellent efficiency without the premium costs of ultra-high efficiency units designed for extreme climates.</p>

<p>Heat pump systems, particularly ductless mini-split configurations, work exceptionally well in Eugene's climate. These systems provide both heating and cooling while operating efficiently in the moderate temperature ranges common to the Willamette Valley. For homes with existing ductwork, upgrading to a high-efficiency gas furnace (90+ AFUE rating) paired with a 16+ SEER air conditioner creates an optimal comfort solution. The marine climate's moderate humidity levels also reduce the need for extensive dehumidification equipment, simplifying HVAC system selection and reducing overall costs.</p>

<h2>Eugene Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Eugene residents have access to multiple incentive programs that significantly reduce solar and HVAC installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on solar installations through 2032, offering substantial savings for Eugene homeowners. This credit applies to the full system cost, including panels, inverters, installation, and permitting fees.</p>

<p>Oregon's Energy Trust program provides cash incentives for high-efficiency HVAC systems, with rebates ranging from \$300-\$1,500 depending on equipment efficiency and type. EWEB offers additional rebates for energy-efficient appliances and systems, including heat pump water heaters and high-efficiency HVAC equipment. The utility also provides free energy audits for residential customers, helping homeowners identify the most cost-effective efficiency improvements. Lane County occasionally offers property tax exemptions for renewable energy installations, providing additional long-term savings for solar adopters.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Eugene</h2>
<p>Eugene's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. The Whiteaker district, with its mix of historic and renovated homes, often requires custom HVAC solutions to work with existing architecture while maximizing solar potential on varied roof orientations. South Eugene's established neighborhoods feature larger lots and mature trees, requiring careful solar site analysis to optimize panel placement while working around shading issues.</p>

<p>The Bethel area's newer construction typically features more solar-ready roof designs and modern electrical systems that simplify installation. West Eugene neighborhoods often benefit from reduced tree shading and favorable south-facing roof orientations. The River Road corridor's mix of housing types creates opportunities for both traditional rooftop solar and ground-mount systems. Downtown Eugene's urban density may limit solar options for some properties, but the area's walkability can reduce overall energy consumption needs.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Eugene</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div>
    <h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in Eugene?</h3>
    <p>Solar panel systems in Eugene typically cost \$3.00-\$3.50 per watt before incentives. A typical 6kW system costs around \$18,000 before the federal tax credit, or approximately \$12,600 after the 30% credit. With EWEB's 10.9¢/kWh rates, homeowners can expect annual savings of \$600-\$1,200 depending on system size and energy usage patterns.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 class="font-bold">What's the best HVAC system for Eugene's marine climate?</h3>
    <p>Heat pump systems excel in Eugene's moderate marine climate. Ductless mini-splits provide optimal efficiency for the 40-80°F temperature range common in the Willamette Valley. For homes with existing ductwork, high-efficiency heat pumps (16+ SEER cooling, 9+ HSPF heating) offer excellent year-round performance without the extreme weather design requirements needed in harsher climates.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 class="font-bold">Does EWEB offer solar rebates?</h3>
    <p>While EWEB doesn't currently offer direct solar rebates, the utility provides net metering for solar customers, allowing excess power to be sold back to the grid at retail rates. EWEB also offers rebates for energy-efficient HVAC equipment and appliances that pair well with solar systems. The utility's time-of-use rates can provide additional value for solar customers who produce power during peak rate periods.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 class="font-bold">How many solar panels do I need for a 1,750 sq ft home in Eugene?</h3>
    <p>Eugene's average 1,750 square foot home typically requires 15-20 solar panels (6-8kW system) to offset annual electricity usage. The exact number depends on roof orientation, shading, energy efficiency, and household consumption patterns. South-facing roofs with minimal shading can maximize production with fewer panels, while east/west orientations may require additional panels to achieve the same output.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 class="font-bold">What permits are required for solar installation in Eugene?</h3>
    <p>Solar installations in Eugene require electrical permits from the city and interconnection agreements with EWEB. Most residential installations qualify for streamlined permitting processes.
