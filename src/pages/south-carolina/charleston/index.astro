const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Charleston, South Carolina</h2>
<p>Charleston's hot-humid climate and abundant sunshine make it an ideal location for solar energy systems. With over 230 sunny days per year and electricity rates of 12.7¢ per kWh from SCE&G, homeowners in this historic coastal city can achieve significant savings by investing in solar panels. The combination of high cooling costs during Charleston's long, sweltering summers and excellent solar irradiance creates the perfect storm for solar energy returns.</p>

<p>The city's 150,227 residents face substantial energy bills, particularly during the humid summer months when HVAC systems work overtime. Charleston's average home size of 1,920 square feet requires efficient heating and cooling solutions that can handle the unique challenges of coastal South Carolina weather. Smart homeowners are increasingly pairing high-efficiency HVAC systems with solar panels to maximize energy savings and reduce their dependence on SCE&G's grid electricity.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in Charleston typically range from \$3.00 to \$3.50 per watt installed. For a typical 1,920 square foot home, a 6-8kW system provides optimal coverage for most electricity needs. The payback period averages 11-13 years, with systems lasting 25-30 years. Charleston's solar irradiance of 4.5-5.0 peak sun hours daily ensures strong performance year-round, even accounting for occasional cloudy weather and summer afternoon thunderstorms.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Charleston</h2>
<p>Charleston's hot-humid climate demands HVAC systems specifically designed for coastal conditions. The ideal system should feature a SEER rating of at least 16-18 for optimal efficiency during the city's long cooling season, which typically runs from April through October. Heat pumps are particularly effective in Charleston's moderate winter climate, providing both heating and cooling while consuming less energy than traditional systems.</p>

<p>Due to Charleston's high humidity levels, proper dehumidification is crucial. Variable-speed air handlers and two-stage compressors help maintain consistent humidity control while reducing energy consumption. Salt air from the nearby Atlantic Ocean requires HVAC equipment with corrosion-resistant components and regular maintenance. Ductwork should be properly sealed and insulated to prevent moisture infiltration, which is common in Charleston's humid environment. For homes with solar panels, pairing a high-efficiency heat pump with smart thermostats can maximize the use of solar-generated electricity during peak production hours.</p>

<h2>Charleston Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Charleston residents benefit from several attractive solar incentives that significantly reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on the total system cost through 2032, then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to both solar panels and solar-powered HVAC systems, making comprehensive energy upgrades more affordable.</p>

<p>South Carolina offers additional incentives including a state tax credit of up to \$3,500 or 25% of system costs, whichever is less. The state also exempts solar installations from property taxes, ensuring your home's increased value won't result in higher tax bills. SCE&G participates in net metering, allowing customers to sell excess solar energy back to the grid at retail rates. The utility also offers rebates for high-efficiency HVAC equipment, with up to \$750 for qualifying heat pumps and air conditioners. Charleston County provides expedited permitting for solar installations, reducing installation time and costs.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Charleston</h2>
<p>Charleston's diverse neighborhoods each present unique opportunities for solar and HVAC installations. Historic downtown Charleston requires special consideration due to preservation guidelines, though many homeowners successfully install solar panels on less visible roof sections or use ground-mount systems in rear yards. The Battery and South of Broad areas feature larger historic homes that benefit significantly from high-efficiency HVAC upgrades and discretely placed solar arrays.</p>

<p>West Ashley neighborhoods like Avondale and Byrnes Down offer excellent solar potential with fewer historic restrictions and typically newer construction that's more solar-ready. Mount Pleasant's planned communities such as I'On and Park West feature modern homes ideal for comprehensive solar-HVAC integration. James Island and Folly Beach properties must account for salt air exposure when selecting HVAC equipment and solar mounting systems. North Charleston's industrial areas and newer subdivisions provide ample space for larger solar installations and often feature homes well-suited for energy efficiency upgrades.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Charleston</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in Charleston?</h3><p>Solar panel installation in Charleston typically costs \$15,000-\$30,000 before incentives, or \$10,500-\$21,000 after the 30% federal tax credit. Most homeowners see payback periods of 11-13 years with annual savings of \$900-\$1,800 depending on system size and energy usage.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">What's the best HVAC system for Charleston's hot-humid climate?</h3><p>Heat pumps with SEER ratings of 16-18 work best in Charleston's climate. Variable-speed systems with enhanced dehumidification handle the high humidity effectively. Look for equipment with corrosion-resistant components due to salt air exposure near the coast.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does SCE&G offer solar rebates?</h3><p>While SCE&G doesn't offer direct solar rebates, they participate in net metering, allowing customers to sell excess solar power back to the grid at retail rates (12.7¢/kWh). They do offer rebates up to \$750 for qualifying high-efficiency HVAC equipment.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Can I install solar panels on a historic Charleston home?</h3><p>Yes, but installation may require approval from the Board of Architectural Review (BAR) for properties in historic districts. Many homeowners successfully install panels on rear-facing roof sections or use ground-mount systems that aren't visible from the street.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How does Charleston's weather affect solar panel performance?</h3><p>Charleston's abundant sunshine (230+ sunny days annually) provides excellent solar production despite occasional storms and humidity. Afternoon thunderstorms actually help keep panels clean, and modern systems are designed to withstand hurricane-force winds when properly installed.</p></div>
