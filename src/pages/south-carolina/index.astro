const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>South Carolina presents an exceptional opportunity for both solar energy adoption and efficient HVAC systems, making it one of the most attractive states in the Southeast for renewable energy investments. With an impressive average of 4.9 sun hours per day and abundant sunshine throughout the year, the Palmetto State offers ideal conditions for solar panel installations. The state's relatively affordable electricity rates averaging 12.5¢ per kilowatt-hour, combined with Duke Energy serving as the primary utility provider across much of the state, create a stable foundation for calculating long-term energy savings and return on investment.</p>

<p>South Carolina's humid subtropical climate presents unique challenges and opportunities for homeowners considering solar and HVAC upgrades. The state experiences hot, humid summers with average temperatures reaching into the 90s, requiring substantial cooling capacity, while winters are generally mild with occasional cold snaps. This climate pattern means that air conditioning systems work extensively from May through September, making energy-efficient HVAC systems crucial for managing utility costs. The combination of high solar irradiance and significant cooling loads creates an ideal scenario where solar panels can offset the increased electricity consumption from air conditioning systems.</p>

<p>The financial benefits of combining solar panels with high-efficiency HVAC systems in South Carolina are particularly compelling. Homeowners can expect to reduce their annual electricity bills by 60-90% with properly sized solar installations, while modern HVAC systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher can cut cooling costs by 20-40% compared to older units. With state and federal incentives available, including South Carolina's 25% state tax credit and the federal 30% solar investment tax credit, the payback period for these investments typically ranges from 8-12 years, after which homeowners enjoy decades of reduced energy costs.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in South Carolina</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>South Carolina ranks among the top states in the Southeast for solar energy potential, with solar irradiance levels ranging from 4.6 to 5.2 kWh/m²/day across different regions of the state. The coastal areas, including Charleston and Myrtle Beach, typically receive the highest levels of solar irradiance, while the upstate regions around Greenville and Spartanburg experience slightly lower but still excellent solar resources. Throughout the year, South Carolina enjoys approximately 2,900 hours of sunshine annually, with peak solar production occurring from April through September when both daylight hours and sun intensity are at their highest.</p>

<p>Seasonal variations in solar production are relatively moderate compared to northern states, with summer months producing 30-40% more energy than winter months. A typical 6kW residential solar system in South Carolina can generate between 7,200-8,400 kWh annually, depending on roof orientation, tilt angle, and shading conditions. South-facing roofs with minimal shading and optimal tilt angles between 30-35 degrees achieve the highest production levels. Even east and west-facing installations can achieve 85-90% of optimal production, making solar viable for most residential properties regardless of roof orientation.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems in South Carolina</h2>

<h3>Climate Considerations</h3>
<p>South Carolina's humid subtropical climate creates specific HVAC requirements that differ significantly from other regions of the United States. The state experiences long, hot summers with high humidity levels often exceeding 70%, requiring air conditioning systems to work continuously from May through September. Average summer temperatures range from 85-95°F, with heat index values frequently reaching over 100°F. This extended cooling season means that air conditioning accounts for 50-70% of annual electricity consumption in most South Carolina homes, making efficient cooling systems essential for managing energy costs.</p>

<p>Winter heating requirements in South Carolina are generally modest, with average winter temperatures ranging from 40-60°F. Most areas experience fewer than 3,000 heating degree days annually, significantly lower than northern states. However, occasional cold snaps can bring temperatures into the 20s, requiring reliable backup heating. Heat pump systems are ideal for South Carolina's climate because they provide efficient cooling during the long summer months and adequate heating during mild winters. For optimal performance, HVAC systems should have SEER ratings of at least 16, with high-efficiency units rated at 18-22 SEER providing the best long-term value in the state's climate.</p>

<p>Humidity control is equally important as temperature control in South Carolina. HVAC systems must be properly sized and equipped with adequate dehumidification capabilities to maintain indoor humidity levels between 40-50%. Oversized systems that cycle on and off frequently often fail to adequately remove humidity, leading to comfort issues and potential mold problems. Variable-speed air handlers and two-stage compressors help maintain consistent temperature and humidity levels while operating more efficiently than single-stage systems.</p>

<h2>South Carolina Incentives & Rebates</h2>
<p>South Carolina offers one of the most generous solar incentive programs in the Southeast, making solar installations particularly attractive for homeowners and businesses. The state provides multiple layers of financial incentives that can significantly reduce the upfront cost of solar panel installations and improve return on investment timelines.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Federal Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC):</strong> The federal government provides a 30% tax credit for solar panel installations completed through 2032. This credit applies to the total cost of the solar system, including equipment, installation, and associated electrical work. For a \$20,000 solar installation, homeowners can claim a \$6,000 federal tax credit. The credit can be carried forward to future tax years if it exceeds current tax liability, and there are no income restrictions or caps on the credit amount.</li>

<li><strong>South Carolina State Tax Credit:</strong> South Carolina offers an additional 25% state tax credit for solar installations, capped at \$5,250 per system or \$17,500 for three or more systems. This credit is claimed on South Carolina state income tax returns and can be carried forward for up to 10 years if it exceeds annual tax liability. Combined with the federal credit, homeowners can reduce their solar installation costs by up to 55%.</li>

<li><strong>Duke Energy Solar Rebate Program:</strong> Duke Energy Carolina and Duke Energy Progress offer rebates for residential solar installations within their service territories. The current rebate is \$0.60 per watt for systems up to 10kW, providing up to \$6,000 for a maximum-sized residential system. Rebate funds are limited and distributed on a first-come, first-served basis, making early application essential.</li>

<li><strong>Property Tax Exemption:</strong> Solar installations are exempt from property tax assessments in South Carolina, meaning that the added value of a solar system won't increase property taxes. This exemption applies to both residential and commercial installations and remains in effect for the life of the solar system.</li>

<li><strong>Net Metering:</strong> South Carolina requires utilities to offer net metering for solar customers, allowing excess solar production to be fed back into the grid for credit against future electricity consumption. Net metering credits are applied at the full retail rate, providing maximum value for solar production that exceeds household consumption.</li>

<li><strong>Local Utility Programs:</strong> Many municipal utilities and electric cooperatives throughout South Carolina offer additional rebates and incentive programs. For example, Santee Cooper offers rebates for energy-efficient HVAC systems, while several municipal utilities provide solar rebates that can be combined with state and federal incentives.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Major Cities in South Carolina</h2>
