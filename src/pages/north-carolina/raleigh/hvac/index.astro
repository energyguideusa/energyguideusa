const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Raleigh</h2>
<p>Raleigh's hot-humid climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, with residents facing long, sweltering summers where temperatures regularly exceed 90°F and humidity levels stay high through September. The 474,069 residents of Wake County rely heavily on air conditioning from May through October, making efficient cooling systems essential for comfort and energy savings. With Duke Energy providing electricity at 11.6¢/kWh, homeowners can expect annual cooling costs between \$800-1,400 depending on their system's efficiency and home size.</p>

<p>The humid subtropical climate means HVAC systems must handle both temperature control and moisture management effectively. High humidity levels can make 80°F feel like 85°F, forcing systems to work harder and driving up energy costs. Additionally, Raleigh's mild winters with occasional freezing temperatures require heating capabilities, though cooling demands dominate annual energy usage. Modern high-efficiency heat pumps and air conditioners with proper dehumidification features are ideal for maximizing comfort while minimizing the impact of Duke Energy's 11.6¢/kWh rates on monthly utility bills.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Raleigh Climate</h2>
<p>For Raleigh's hot-humid climate, heat pumps with SEER ratings of 16-20 offer the best year-round efficiency, providing both cooling and heating capabilities ideal for the region's mild winters and intense summers. Two-stage or variable-speed systems excel at humidity control, running longer at lower speeds to remove moisture while maintaining comfortable temperatures. During Raleigh's 6-month cooling season, these systems can reduce energy consumption by 20-40% compared to single-stage units, translating to \$200-500 annual savings at Duke Energy's 11.6¢/kWh rates. For heating, heat pumps remain efficient down to 25°F, covering most of Raleigh's winter needs, though backup electric strips handle occasional sub-freezing nights. Consider 18+ SEER ratings for maximum efficiency, especially in homes over 2,000 square feet where the higher upfront costs are quickly recovered through reduced cooling bills during Raleigh's long, humid summers.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Raleigh</h2>
<p>Raleigh homeowners can access substantial savings through federal tax credits offering 30% back on qualifying heat pumps and high-efficiency systems installed through 2032, with no cap on the credit amount. Duke Energy provides rebates up to \$600 for ENERGY STAR certified heat pumps and \$300 for qualifying air conditioners with 16+ SEER ratings, plus additional incentives for smart thermostats (\$50-100) and whole-home energy improvements. North Carolina offers income-qualified weatherization programs and periodic state tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements, though these vary by year and legislative session. Combined with federal credits, Wake County residents can potentially recover 30-40% of their HVAC investment, making high-efficiency systems more affordable while reducing long-term energy costs at Duke Energy's current 11.6¢/kWh rate structure.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Raleigh</h2>
<p>Select licensed North Carolina HVAC contractors with specific experience in Raleigh's hot-humid climate challenges, including proper sizing calculations and humidity control expertise essential for optimal system performance. Verify contractors carry current NC licensing, liability insurance, and manufacturer certifications from major brands like Carrier, Trane, or Lennox, which ensure access to equipment warranties and factory support. Look for companies offering comprehensive warranties covering both parts (5-12 years) and labor (2-5 years), plus 24/7 emergency service crucial during Raleigh's sweltering summer months when AC failures create health risks. Check Better Business Bureau ratings, Google reviews, and ask for recent local references, prioritizing contractors who provide detailed written estimates, explain Duke Energy rebate processes, and demonstrate knowledge of Wake County permit requirements for HVAC installations.</p>
