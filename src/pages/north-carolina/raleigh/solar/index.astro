const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Raleigh</h2>
<p>Raleigh, North Carolina presents excellent opportunities for solar panel installation, with over 474,000 residents in Wake County benefiting from the state's abundant sunshine and favorable solar policies. The city's hot-humid climate provides consistent solar irradiance throughout the year, making it an ideal location for homeowners looking to reduce their dependence on Duke Energy's grid electricity. With current electricity rates at 11.6¢/kWh, Raleigh residents pay above the national average, creating significant potential for savings through solar energy systems.</p>

<p>The hot-humid climate in Raleigh means solar panels will experience high temperatures during summer months, which can slightly reduce efficiency, but the abundant sunshine more than compensates for this effect. Modern solar panels are designed to perform well in these conditions, and Raleigh's average of 213 sunny days per year provides ample opportunity for energy generation. Duke Energy's net metering program allows homeowners to sell excess power back to the grid, further enhancing the financial benefits of solar installation in the Triangle area.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Raleigh</h2>
<p>Raleigh homeowners can take advantage of several lucrative solar incentives that significantly reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit on the total system cost, including installation, which remains at 30% through 2032 before stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. North Carolina offers additional state-level incentives, including a state tax credit of up to 35% of the system cost (capped at \$10,500 for residential installations). Duke Energy customers in Raleigh can also benefit from the utility's net metering program, which provides credit for excess solar energy fed back into the grid at the retail rate of 11.6¢/kWh. Property tax exemptions are available for the added value solar panels bring to homes, ensuring homeowners won't pay additional property taxes on their solar investment.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Raleigh</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in Raleigh, homeowners should prioritize companies with proper North Carolina licensing, NABCEP-certified installers, and extensive local experience in Wake County. Look for installers who are familiar with Duke Energy's interconnection requirements and local permitting processes in Raleigh. The best solar companies will offer comprehensive warranties covering equipment (typically 20-25 years for panels, 10-12 years for inverters) and workmanship (minimum 10 years). Verify that potential installers carry proper insurance, have strong local references, and provide detailed proposals that include system design, expected energy production, and realistic payback calculations based on Raleigh's specific solar irradiance levels. Companies should also assist with rebate applications and handle all permitting and utility interconnection paperwork to ensure a smooth installation process.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Raleigh</h2>
<p>Solar panel investments in Raleigh typically achieve payback periods of 12-14 years, with 25-year savings ranging from \$15,000 to \$30,000 depending on system size and energy usage. Based on Raleigh's electricity rate of 11.6¢/kWh and average annual rate increases of 2-3%, a typical 6kW system costing \$12,600 after federal tax credits will generate approximately \$974 in annual savings. Over the 25-year warranty period of most solar panels, homeowners can expect total savings of \$24,350, representing a strong return on investment even accounting for minimal maintenance costs. The hot-humid climate in Raleigh means panels may need occasional cleaning to maintain peak efficiency, but modern solar systems require virtually no maintenance beyond periodic inspections. With Duke Energy's net metering program and North Carolina's renewable energy-friendly policies, solar ROI in Raleigh remains attractive compared to other investment options.</p>
