const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Durham</h2>
<p>Durham, North Carolina's hot-humid climate presents unique challenges for the city's 283,506 residents when it comes to heating and cooling their homes. With sweltering summers reaching into the 90s and high humidity levels that can make temperatures feel even hotter, air conditioning systems work overtime from May through September. The humid subtropical climate means HVAC systems must not only cool effectively but also manage moisture levels to prevent mold growth and maintain indoor air quality. Winter temperatures, while milder than northern regions, still dip into the 30s and 40s, requiring reliable heating solutions.</p>

<p>Energy efficiency becomes crucial when considering Durham County's electricity rate of 11.6¢/kWh through Duke Energy. During peak summer months, cooling costs can account for 60-70% of a household's energy bill, making high-efficiency HVAC systems a smart investment. The combination of extended cooling seasons and moderate heating needs means Durham homeowners should prioritize systems with excellent SEER ratings for air conditioning while ensuring adequate heating capacity for occasional cold snaps and ice storms that can affect the region.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Durham Climate</h2>
<p>For Durham's hot-humid climate, homeowners should prioritize air conditioning systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher, with 18-20 SEER units providing optimal efficiency for the extended cooling season. Heat pumps are particularly well-suited for Durham County because they provide both heating and cooling in one system, handling the mild winters efficiently while delivering excellent summer cooling. The heating capacity rarely needs to exceed the cooling capacity, making heat pumps more cost-effective than separate furnace and AC systems. Variable-speed systems excel in humid climates like Durham's because they run longer at lower speeds, providing better dehumidification while maintaining consistent temperatures. For homes over 2,500 square feet, consider zoned systems to manage the varying cooling needs throughout multi-story homes, especially important given Durham's humidity levels that can create different comfort zones within the same house.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Durham</h2>
<p>Durham residents can take advantage of several rebate programs to offset HVAC installation costs. The federal Residential Clean Energy Credit offers 30% tax credits through 2032 for qualifying heat pump installations, potentially saving homeowners \$2,000-3,000 on high-efficiency systems. North Carolina offers additional state tax credits up to \$8,000 for ENERGY STAR certified heat pumps installed in existing homes. Duke Energy provides rebates ranging from \$300-600 for qualifying high-efficiency heat pumps and air conditioning units with SEER ratings of 16 or higher. The utility also offers financing programs with reduced interest rates for energy-efficient upgrades. Additionally, Durham County participates in the Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program, allowing homeowners to finance HVAC upgrades through their property tax bills with no upfront costs. These combined incentives can reduce the total cost of a new HVAC system by \$3,000-5,000 for many Durham homeowners.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Durham</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in Durham requires careful consideration of several key factors. Ensure any contractor holds a valid North Carolina contractor's license and HVAC specialty license, which can be verified through the NC Board of Examiners of Plumbing, Heating and Fire Sprinkler Contractors. Look for contractors with extensive experience in Durham's climate conditions and familiarity with Duke Energy's rebate programs and requirements. Quality contractors should provide detailed written estimates, offer manufacturer warranties of 10+ years on equipment plus 2-5 years on labor, and carry comprehensive insurance coverage. Emergency service availability is crucial given Durham's unpredictable weather patterns, including summer storms that can damage outdoor units and winter ice storms that may affect heating systems. Check Better Business Bureau ratings, Google reviews, and ask for local references from recent customers. The best Durham HVAC contractors will perform thorough load calculations to properly size systems for your home's specific needs, rather than simply replacing existing equipment with the same size units.</p>
