const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Durham</h2>
<p>Durham, North Carolina presents excellent opportunities for solar energy adoption with its population of 283,506 residents benefiting from abundant sunshine throughout the year. The city's hot-humid climate provides ideal conditions for solar panels, with high solar irradiance levels that can generate substantial electricity production. With Duke Energy serving as the primary utility provider and electricity rates at 11.6¢ per kWh, Durham homeowners can achieve significant savings by switching to solar power, especially considering that North Carolina ranks among the top states for solar energy production.</p>

<p>The hot-humid climate in Durham County actually works in favor of solar installations, as modern solar panels are designed to perform efficiently even in high temperatures and humidity. Duke Energy's net metering program allows Durham residents to sell excess solar power back to the grid, creating additional savings opportunities. With the combination of favorable weather conditions, supportive utility policies, and competitive electricity rates, solar installations in Durham typically pay for themselves within 8-12 years while providing decades of clean, renewable energy.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Durham</h2>
<p>Durham residents can take advantage of several valuable solar incentives that significantly reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit for solar installations completed through 2032, stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. North Carolina offers additional state-level incentives including property tax exemptions for solar equipment, meaning the added value of solar panels won't increase your property taxes. Duke Energy also provides interconnection agreements for net metering, allowing homeowners to receive credits for excess solar energy fed back into the grid. Additionally, Durham County has streamlined permitting processes for residential solar installations, reducing both time and costs associated with getting your system approved and connected.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Durham</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in Durham, prioritize companies with proper North Carolina electrical contractor licenses, NABCEP-certified installers, and extensive local experience in Durham County's specific requirements. Look for installers who offer comprehensive warranties covering both equipment (typically 20-25 years for panels) and workmanship (minimum 10 years). Top-rated Durham solar companies should provide detailed site assessments, custom system designs based on your roof's orientation and shading, and transparent pricing with no hidden fees. Verify that your chosen installer has experience working with Duke Energy's interconnection requirements and can handle all permitting processes. Check Better Business Bureau ratings, Google reviews, and ask for local references from recent installations in the Durham area to ensure quality workmanship and customer service.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Durham</h2>
<p>Solar installations in Durham typically achieve payback periods of 10-13 years based on the current electricity rate of 11.6¢ per kWh and average system costs. A typical 6kW residential solar system costing \$18,000 before incentives will save approximately \$975 annually on electricity bills, resulting in a 12.9-year payback period after applying the 30% federal tax credit. Over the 25-year warranty period of most solar panels, Durham homeowners can expect total savings of \$24,375, representing a net profit of \$11,775 after recovering the initial investment. These calculations assume a modest 2% annual increase in electricity rates, which could accelerate payback times. With Duke Energy's net metering program, excess solar production during peak sunlight hours offsets evening electricity usage, maximizing the financial benefits throughout the year.</p>
