<h2>Solar Panels in Rhode Island</h2>
<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Rhode Island's solar resource is stronger than many residents realize, with the state receiving approximately 4.2 peak sun hours per day on average throughout the year. This translates to excellent solar production potential, with a typical residential solar panel system generating between 1,100 and 1,400 kilowatt-hours per kilowatt installed annually. The state's coastal location provides consistent solar irradiance with fewer extreme weather events that could damage solar equipment compared to other regions.</p>

<p>Seasonal variations in Rhode Island show peak production during summer months (May through September) when days are longer and sun angles are optimal. However, even during winter months, solar panels continue to generate significant electricity, often performing better in cooler temperatures. Snow rarely accumulates on properly installed panels due to their angle and smooth surface, and the reflective properties of snow can actually boost production on clear winter days. Most Rhode Island solar installations are oriented south-facing with tilt angles between 30-40 degrees to optimize year-round production.</p>

<p>The state's Renewable Energy Growth (REG) program provides performance-based incentives for solar installations, offering long-term contracts that pay solar owners for the clean energy they produce. Current REG rates for residential systems range from \$0.285 to \$0.335 per kilowatt-hour produced over 15-20 year terms, providing predictable income streams that significantly improve solar investment returns. The program includes bonus payments for systems that incorporate battery storage or are installed on affordable housing properties.</p>

<p>National Grid offers substantial rebates for high-efficiency HVAC equipment through their EnergyWise program. Heat pump rebates can reach \$1,250 per ton for qualifying systems with SEER ratings of 15+ and HSPF ratings of 8.5+. Central air conditioning systems qualify for rebates up to \$600, while high-efficiency furnaces can receive rebates up to \$850. The utility also provides enhanced rebates for customers who participate in demand response programs or install smart thermostats.</p>

<p>Additional state programs include property tax exemptions for solar installations, meaning the added home value from solar panels doesn't increase property tax assessments. Rhode Island also offers net metering with full retail rate credits, allowing solar owners to bank excess production during sunny periods to offset usage during cloudy days or peak demand periods. Low-interest financing options are available through the Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank's Efficient Buildings Fund, offering loans up to \$50,000 for qualifying solar and HVAC improvements.</p>
