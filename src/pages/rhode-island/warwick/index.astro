const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Warwick, Rhode Island</h2>
<p>Warwick, Rhode Island presents an excellent opportunity for homeowners to invest in solar panels and efficient HVAC systems. With 82,823 residents in Kent County facing electricity rates of 19.5¢ per kWh through National Grid—significantly higher than the national average—solar energy offers substantial long-term savings. The city's coastal location provides good solar irradiance despite Rhode Island's compact size, making solar installations increasingly attractive for the typical 1,680 square foot homes throughout Warwick.</p>

<p>The cold climate in Warwick creates unique energy demands that make the combination of solar and efficient HVAC systems particularly beneficial. Winter heating costs can be substantial with National Grid's elevated rates, but modern heat pump technology combined with solar generation can dramatically reduce energy expenses. Warwick homeowners who invest in both solar panels and high-efficiency HVAC systems often see the greatest return on investment, especially given Rhode Island's supportive renewable energy policies and net metering programs through National Grid.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in Warwick reflect competitive pricing for the New England region, with installation costs averaging \$3.10 per watt before incentives. The high electricity rates from National Grid at 19.5¢ per kWh make solar particularly attractive, as each kilowatt-hour of solar production saves nearly 20 cents compared to grid electricity. Most Warwick homes with typical 1,680 square foot layouts require 6-8kW systems to offset 80-100% of their annual electricity usage, resulting in payback periods of 7-9 years.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Warwick</h2>
<p>Warwick's cold climate demands robust HVAC systems capable of handling harsh New England winters while maintaining efficiency during mild summers. For this climate zone, heat pumps with cold-climate capabilities are increasingly popular, particularly models rated for operation down to -15°F or lower. Air-source heat pumps with SEER ratings of 16-20 and HSPF ratings of 9-12 provide excellent year-round efficiency, while geothermal systems offer premium performance for homeowners willing to invest in the highest efficiency options.</p>

<p>Traditional heating systems in Warwick often rely on oil or propane, but electric heat pumps paired with solar panels create an compelling alternative. For air conditioning, systems with SEER ratings of at least 16 are recommended to handle summer humidity while maintaining efficiency. Ductless mini-split systems work exceptionally well in Warwick's older homes, providing zone-based heating and cooling without extensive ductwork modifications. Given the 1,680 square foot average home size, most properties require 2-3 ton systems for adequate heating and cooling capacity.</p>

<h2>Warwick Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Warwick residents have access to several valuable incentives for solar and HVAC installations. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit provides 30% of system costs back as a tax credit through 2032, then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Rhode Island offers additional state incentives through the Renewable Energy Growth Program, which provides long-term contracts for solar energy production at favorable rates above standard net metering.</p>

<p>National Grid provides rebates for high-efficiency HVAC equipment, including up to \$750 for ENERGY STAR certified air-source heat pumps and up to \$1,250 for cold-climate heat pumps. The utility also offers rebates for smart thermostats, insulation improvements, and weatherization services that complement solar and HVAC upgrades. Rhode Island's property tax exemption for renewable energy systems means solar installations won't increase property tax assessments, providing additional long-term savings for Warwick homeowners.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Warwick</h2>
<p>Warwick's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. Conimicut, with its waterfront properties and larger lots, offers excellent solar potential but may require salt-resistant equipment due to coastal exposure. The Rocky Point and Shawomet areas feature many mid-century homes that benefit significantly from ductless mini-split systems and rooftop solar arrays.</p>

<p>Apponaug's historic downtown area includes older homes that may need electrical upgrades before solar installation, but the neighborhood's tree-lined streets require careful panel placement to avoid shading issues. Warwick Neck's prestigious waterfront properties often have optimal southern exposure for solar panels, while the area's larger homes may benefit from zoned HVAC systems. Hillsgrove and Norwood neighborhoods, with their suburban ranch and colonial-style homes, typically provide straightforward installations for both solar panels and central HVAC systems, making them ideal for comprehensive energy efficiency upgrades.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Warwick</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in Warwick?</h3><p>Solar panel installations in Warwick typically cost \$15,500-\$31,000 before incentives, depending on system size. After the 30% federal tax credit, costs range from \$10,850-\$21,700. With National Grid's high electricity rates at 19.5¢/kWh, most homeowners see payback periods of 7-9 years and annual savings of \$1,365-\$2,730 depending on system size.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">What's the best HVAC system for Warwick's cold climate?</h3><p>Cold-climate heat pumps are ideal for Warwick, providing efficient heating down to -15°F while offering air conditioning in summer. Look for systems with SEER ratings of 16+ and HSPF ratings of 9+. Ductless mini-splits work well for older homes, while geothermal systems provide premium efficiency for new construction or major renovations.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does National Grid offer solar rebates in Warwick?</h3><p>While National Grid doesn't offer direct solar rebates, they provide net metering that credits solar production at retail rates. Rhode Island's Renewable Energy Growth Program, administered through National Grid, offers long-term contracts for solar energy. National Grid does provide rebates up to \$1,250 for high-efficiency heat pumps and other HVAC equipment.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How long do solar panels last in Rhode Island's climate?</h3><p>Solar panels in Warwick typically last 25-30 years with minimal degradation. Rhode Island's coastal climate can be harsh, but quality panels with proper installation handle snow loads, wind, and salt air well. Most manufacturers offer 20-25 year production warranties, and panels often continue producing electricity well beyond their warranty periods.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Can I run my heat pump on solar power in Warwick?</h3><p>Yes, properly sized solar systems can power heat pumps effectively in Warwick. A 6-8kW solar system typically generates enough electricity to run a heat pump for most of the year. During winter months with less solar production, net metering credits from summer overproduction help offset grid electricity usage, making the combination highly cost-effective.</p></div>
