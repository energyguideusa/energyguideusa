const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Iowa City, Iowa</h2>
<p>Iowa City, home to 74,828 residents in Johnson County, presents unique opportunities for solar and HVAC investments despite its cold climate. While Iowa experiences harsh winters with temperatures often dropping below freezing, the area receives substantial sunlight during spring and summer months, making solar panels surprisingly effective. With electricity rates at 11.3¢ per kWh through Iowa City Power, homeowners can achieve significant savings by reducing their dependence on the grid, especially during peak summer cooling periods when energy demand and costs are highest.</p>

<p>The cold climate in Iowa City creates specific HVAC challenges that make energy efficiency crucial for the typical 1,680 square foot homes in the area. High-efficiency heating systems are essential for managing winter utility bills, while proper cooling systems ensure comfort during humid Iowa summers. When combined with solar panels, modern HVAC systems can operate more cost-effectively, using clean energy generated on-site to power heat pumps, furnaces, and air conditioning units throughout the year.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in Iowa City typically range from \$3.00 to \$3.50 per watt before incentives, with installation costs varying based on roof complexity, equipment quality, and installer selection. The average 1,680 square foot home in Iowa City can typically accommodate a 6-8kW system, which generates enough electricity to offset 70-90% of annual energy usage. With Iowa City Power's net metering program, excess solar production during sunny periods can be credited back to your account, further enhancing the financial benefits of solar installation.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Iowa City</h2>
<p>Iowa City's cold climate demands robust HVAC systems capable of handling temperature extremes from sub-zero winters to hot, humid summers. For heating, high-efficiency furnaces with AFUE ratings of 90% or higher are recommended, with many homeowners opting for variable-speed gas furnaces or dual-fuel heat pump systems. Heat pumps work effectively as primary heating sources down to about 25°F, making them viable for shoulder seasons while gas backup handles the coldest winter months.</p>

<p>For cooling systems, SEER ratings of 16-20 are optimal for Iowa City's climate, balancing efficiency with reasonable equipment costs. Variable-speed air conditioners and heat pumps provide superior humidity control during Iowa's muggy summers while consuming less energy than single-stage units. Geothermal systems are particularly effective in Iowa City due to stable ground temperatures, offering year-round efficiency for both heating and cooling. When paired with solar panels, these high-efficiency HVAC systems can operate with minimal grid electricity, significantly reducing utility bills for the typical 1,680 square foot home.</p>

<h2>Iowa City Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Iowa City residents benefit from several attractive energy incentives that make solar and HVAC upgrades more affordable. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on total solar installation costs through 2032, before stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the entire system cost including equipment, installation, and electrical work, representing thousands in direct tax savings for most homeowners.</p>

<p>Iowa offers additional state-level incentives including property and sales tax exemptions for solar installations, meaning your home's assessed value won't increase for property tax purposes despite the added solar value. Iowa City Power participates in various energy efficiency rebate programs, offering rebates for high-efficiency HVAC equipment, smart thermostats, and weatherization improvements. The utility also provides net metering for solar customers, crediting excess production at retail rates. Additionally, Iowa's Renewable Energy Tax Credit provides state tax credits for qualifying renewable energy systems, though funding is limited and allocated on a first-come basis.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Iowa City</h2>
<p>Iowa City's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. The historic downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods like Longfellow and Roosevelt feature older homes with character but may require electrical upgrades and careful roof assessments before solar installation. These areas often have mature tree coverage that requires professional shading analysis to optimize solar panel placement.</p>

<p>Newer developments on the west side, including areas near the University of Iowa Research Park and Coral Ridge Mall, typically feature modern homes with south-facing roof orientations ideal for solar panels. The Coralville border areas and newer subdivisions often have larger lots and fewer shading issues, making them excellent candidates for ground-mount solar systems. Eastside neighborhoods like Goosetown and areas near City High School offer a mix of housing styles, with many mid-century homes perfect for HVAC upgrades and solar retrofits. The Hills and Tiffin areas, while technically separate communities, serve the greater Iowa City market and feature newer construction with energy-efficient designs that complement solar and modern HVAC systems.</p>
