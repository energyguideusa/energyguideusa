const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Arlington</h2>
<p>Arlington, Texas, home to 398,854 residents in Tarrant County, faces unique HVAC challenges due to its hot-humid climate. With summer temperatures regularly exceeding 95°F and humidity levels often above 60%, Arlington homeowners rely heavily on air conditioning systems that must work overtime from May through September. The combination of intense heat and high humidity puts tremendous strain on HVAC equipment, making system efficiency and reliability critical factors for comfort and cost management.</p>

<p>Energy costs play a significant role in HVAC decision-making for Arlington residents, with Oncor delivering electricity at an average rate of 12.1¢/kWh. During peak summer months, cooling costs can account for 60-70% of a household's energy bill, making high-efficiency HVAC systems a smart investment. The hot-humid climate also requires systems with excellent dehumidification capabilities, as managing moisture levels is just as important as temperature control for indoor comfort and preventing mold growth in Arlington homes.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Arlington Climate</h2>
<p>For Arlington's hot-humid climate, HVAC systems with a minimum 16 SEER rating are recommended, though 18+ SEER units provide optimal efficiency for the extended cooling season. Two-stage or variable-speed compressors excel in this climate by running longer at lower speeds, which improves dehumidification while maintaining consistent temperatures. Heat pumps are particularly effective in Arlington since heating demands are moderate, typically only needed from December through February, making year-round heat pump operation more efficient than traditional AC/gas furnace combinations. Systems should include enhanced dehumidification features or whole-home dehumidifiers to manage the high moisture loads common in North Texas summers. For optimal performance, look for units with advanced inverter technology that can adjust output based on real-time conditions, providing superior comfort and energy savings during Arlington's variable weather patterns.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Arlington</h2>
<p>Arlington residents can access multiple rebate programs to offset HVAC upgrade costs. Federal tax credits offer up to \$2,000 for qualifying heat pumps and up to \$600 for high-efficiency central air conditioners installed through 2032. Oncor, Arlington's primary utility provider, offers rebates up to \$1,200 for ENERGY STAR certified heat pumps and up to \$500 for qualifying central AC units through their Energy Efficiency Program. Additional rebates of \$200-400 are available for programmable thermostats and duct sealing services. Texas state programs occasionally offer additional incentives through the State Energy Conservation Office, particularly for low-income households. Many local HVAC contractors also provide manufacturer rebates that can stack with utility incentives, potentially reducing total system costs by \$2,000-4,000. To maximize savings, Arlington homeowners should verify current rebate availability before installation and ensure all equipment meets ENERGY STAR requirements.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Arlington</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in Arlington requires careful consideration of licensing, experience, and local climate expertise. All contractors must hold valid TACLA (Texas Air Conditioning Contractors License) certification and maintain proper bonding and insurance. Look for contractors with specific experience in Arlington's hot-humid climate who understand the importance of proper sizing, ductwork design, and humidity control. Quality contractors should provide detailed load calculations using Manual J methodology, offer multiple equipment options with clear efficiency comparisons, and guarantee their installation work for at least two years. Emergency service availability is crucial in Arlington's extreme summer heat, so prioritize contractors offering 24/7 service during peak season. Check Better Business Bureau ratings, Google reviews, and ask for local references from recent customers. The best contractors will also provide ongoing maintenance agreements and can demonstrate knowledge of local rebate programs to help maximize your investment.</p>
