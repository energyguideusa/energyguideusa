const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Arlington</h2>
<p>Arlington's hot-humid climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, with summer temperatures regularly exceeding 95°F and humidity levels often above 70%. The city's 398,854 residents rely heavily on air conditioning from May through September, making efficient cooling systems essential for comfort and manageable energy bills. With Oncor providing electricity at 12.1¢/kWh—slightly above the national average—choosing the right HVAC system can significantly impact annual energy costs, which typically range from \$1,800 to \$2,400 for cooling alone in average-sized homes.</p>

<p>The hot-humid conditions in Tarrant County require HVAC systems that excel at both temperature control and humidity management. Systems must run efficiently during peak summer months while handling moisture loads that can strain equipment and reduce indoor air quality. High-efficiency units with proper sizing and advanced humidity control features are crucial investments for Arlington homeowners, as undersized or inefficient systems will struggle with the demanding climate and lead to excessive energy consumption and premature equipment failure.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Arlington Climate</h2>
<p>For Arlington's hot-humid climate, HVAC systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher are recommended, with 18+ SEER units providing optimal efficiency during the long cooling season. Variable-speed air handlers and two-stage compressors excel in humid conditions by running longer at lower speeds, which improves dehumidification and maintains consistent temperatures. Heat pumps are particularly effective in Arlington since heating demands are minimal—typically only 30-40 days per year require heating—making the year-round efficiency of heat pump systems highly cost-effective. Systems should be properly sized for cooling loads, as oversized units will short-cycle and fail to adequately remove humidity, leading to comfort issues and higher operating costs despite the climate's heating-to-cooling ratio favoring cooling by approximately 85% to 15%.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Arlington</h2>
<p>Arlington residents can access multiple rebate programs to offset HVAC installation costs. Federal tax credits provide up to \$2,000 for qualifying heat pumps and up to \$600 for central air conditioners with SEER ratings of 16 or higher, available through 2032 under the Inflation Reduction Act. Oncor offers rebates ranging from \$50 to \$200 for high-efficiency air conditioning units and heat pumps that meet ENERGY STAR criteria. The City of Arlington occasionally provides additional incentives through energy efficiency programs, particularly for low-to-moderate income households. Texas also offers property tax exemptions for renewable energy systems, and some local utilities provide time-of-use rate programs that can reduce cooling costs by 15-25% for customers who can shift energy usage to off-peak hours during Arlington's hot summer afternoons.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Arlington</h2>
<p>When selecting an HVAC contractor in Arlington, verify they hold current Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Contractor licenses and are bonded and insured. Look for contractors with specific experience in hot-humid climates who understand proper equipment sizing, humidity control, and ductwork design for Texas conditions. Quality contractors should provide detailed load calculations, offer multiple equipment options with clear efficiency comparisons, and provide comprehensive warranties covering both parts and labor for at least five years. Emergency service availability is crucial in Arlington's climate—verify contractors offer 24/7 service during peak summer months when system failures can create dangerous indoor conditions. Request references from recent Arlington customers and check Better Business Bureau ratings, ensuring the contractor has successfully completed installations similar to your home's size and age.</p>
