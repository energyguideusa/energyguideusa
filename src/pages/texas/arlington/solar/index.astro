const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Arlington</h2>
<p>Arlington, Texas presents excellent opportunities for solar panel installation, with its hot-humid climate providing abundant sunshine throughout the year. Located in Tarrant County, this city of 398,854 residents experiences over 230 sunny days annually, making it ideal for solar energy generation. With electricity rates averaging 12.1¢/kWh through Oncor Electric Delivery, Arlington homeowners can achieve significant savings by switching to solar power, especially during the peak summer months when air conditioning costs soar.</p>

<p>The hot-humid climate in Arlington means higher energy consumption for cooling, but it also translates to excellent solar production potential. Oncor's net metering program allows Arlington residents to sell excess solar energy back to the grid at retail rates, maximizing the financial benefits of solar installation. The combination of high electricity rates and abundant sunshine creates favorable conditions for solar panel systems, with most residential installations paying for themselves within 7-9 years through energy savings alone.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Arlington</h2>
<p>Arlington residents can take advantage of several solar incentives to reduce installation costs significantly. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit on the total system cost, including equipment and installation, through 2032. This credit directly reduces your federal tax liability dollar-for-dollar. Texas offers additional benefits including no state income tax on solar savings and property tax exemptions for the added home value from solar installations. While Texas doesn't have state-level rebates, some local programs and Oncor's net metering allow you to earn credits for excess energy production. Additionally, many Arlington solar companies offer financing options with zero-down payments, making solar accessible without upfront costs.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Arlington</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in Arlington, prioritize companies with proper Texas licensing, NABCEP-certified installers, and extensive local experience in Tarrant County's specific building codes and weather conditions. Look for installers who offer comprehensive warranties covering equipment (typically 20-25 years for panels, 10-12 years for inverters) and workmanship (minimum 10 years). The best Arlington solar companies will provide detailed energy production estimates based on your specific roof orientation, shading analysis, and historical weather data. Verify their Better Business Bureau rating, read recent customer reviews, and ensure they handle all permitting and interconnection processes with Oncor. Request multiple quotes and compare not just pricing, but also equipment quality, warranty terms, and post-installation monitoring and maintenance services.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Arlington</h2>
<p>Based on Arlington's electricity rate of 12.1¢/kWh and average annual sunshine, a typical 6kW solar system generates approximately 12,600 kWh annually, resulting in \$1,524 in yearly savings. After the 30% federal tax credit, the net investment of \$12,600 provides a payback period of approximately 8.3 years. Over the 25-year warranty period, Arlington homeowners can expect total savings exceeding \$38,000, representing a return on investment of over 200%. These calculations assume a 3% annual electricity rate increase, which is conservative based on historical Texas utility rate trends. The hot-humid climate actually benefits solar panel efficiency during cooler months, while summer production remains strong despite higher temperatures. With Oncor's net metering program, excess production during peak sun hours offsets evening and night consumption, maximizing the financial benefits throughout the year.</p>
