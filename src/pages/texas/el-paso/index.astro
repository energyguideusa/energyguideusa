const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in El Paso, Texas</h2>
<p>El Paso, Texas, with its population of 678,815 residents in El Paso County, represents one of the most promising markets for solar energy in the United States. The city's hot-dry climate delivers over 300 days of sunshine annually, creating ideal conditions for solar panel efficiency and maximum energy production. With El Paso Electric serving the region at rates of 11.3¢/kWh, homeowners face significant electricity costs, especially during the intense summer months when air conditioning systems work overtime to combat temperatures that regularly exceed 100°F.</p>

<p>The combination of abundant sunshine and elevated energy costs makes El Paso a perfect storm for solar adoption and HVAC optimization. The hot-dry climate, while challenging for cooling systems, actually benefits solar panel performance due to low humidity and minimal cloud cover. El Paso Electric has recognized this potential and offers various programs to support renewable energy adoption, making the transition to solar power both environmentally and financially attractive for the city's residents living in homes averaging 1,950 square feet.</p>

<p>Solar panel installations in El Paso typically range from \$3.00 to \$3.50 per watt before incentives, making the city competitive with national averages while offering superior energy production potential. The high solar irradiance levels in El Paso mean that systems generate approximately 1,500-1,700 kWh per kW installed annually, significantly higher than many other regions. With El Paso Electric's net metering program, excess energy produced during peak sun hours can be fed back into the grid, providing credits that offset evening and winter usage when solar production is lower.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for El Paso</h2>
<p>El Paso's hot-dry climate presents unique challenges and opportunities for HVAC systems. The extreme summer temperatures, often exceeding 100°F for extended periods, demand robust cooling solutions, while the low humidity levels allow for more efficient operation of certain HVAC technologies. For traditional central air systems, a minimum SEER rating of 16-18 is recommended, though high-efficiency units with SEER ratings of 20+ can provide substantial long-term savings given the intensive cooling demands.</p>

<p>Evaporative cooling systems, also known as swamp coolers, are particularly effective in El Paso's dry climate and can reduce cooling costs by 50-75% compared to traditional air conditioning. However, for homes with solar panels, pairing a high-efficiency heat pump system with SEER ratings of 18-22 creates an optimal balance of comfort and energy efficiency. The dry climate also makes El Paso ideal for variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems in larger homes, which can provide zoned cooling while maintaining high efficiency levels throughout the 1,950 square foot average home size.</p>

<h2>El Paso Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>El Paso residents benefit from multiple layers of solar incentives that significantly reduce the upfront costs of installation. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on the total system cost, including equipment and installation, through 2032. This credit can be applied directly against federal tax liability and can be carried forward if the credit exceeds taxes owed in the installation year.</p>

<p>While Texas doesn't offer state-level solar rebates, El Paso Electric provides net metering programs that credit customers for excess solar energy fed back into the grid at retail rates of 11.3¢/kWh. Additionally, solar panel systems are exempt from property tax increases in Texas, meaning homeowners won't see their property taxes rise despite the added home value from solar installation. Local contractors often provide additional financing incentives, including zero-down solar leasing programs and power purchase agreements (PPAs) that allow homeowners to benefit from solar energy without upfront costs.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in El Paso</h2>
<p>El Paso's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. The affluent Westside neighborhoods, including Coronado Hills and Country Club, feature larger homes with expansive roof space ideal for substantial solar arrays, though homeowners associations may have aesthetic requirements for panel placement. These areas also benefit from newer construction with modern HVAC infrastructure that integrates well with solar systems.</p>

<p>Central El Paso neighborhoods like Sunset Heights and Manhattan Heights offer excellent solar potential with older homes that often benefit significantly from HVAC upgrades paired with solar installations. The Northeast areas, including Cielo Vista and Vista Hills, represent emerging markets for solar adoption with moderate-sized homes perfectly suited for 6-8kW solar systems. East El Paso neighborhoods such as Segundo Barrio and Riverside often feature smaller homes where compact, high-efficiency solar and HVAC solutions provide maximum impact. Each area's specific utility infrastructure and building codes may affect installation requirements and costs.</p>

<h2>FAQs for El Paso</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in El Paso?</h3><p>Solar panel systems in El Paso typically cost \$3.00-\$3.50 per watt before incentives. For an average 1,950 sq ft home, a 6-7kW system costing \$18,000-\$21,000 before the 30% federal tax credit would provide substantial energy savings. After the federal credit, homeowners pay \$12,600-\$14,700, with annual savings of \$1,020-\$1,190 based on El Paso Electric's 11.3¢/kWh rate.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">What's the best HVAC system for El Paso's hot-dry climate?</h3><p>For El Paso's hot-dry climate, high-efficiency central air systems with SEER ratings of 18+ work well, but evaporative cooling can reduce costs by 50-75%. Heat pump systems with SEER 20+ ratings paired with solar panels offer optimal efficiency. The low humidity makes evaporative cooling highly effective, while the intense heat requires robust cooling capacity of 1 ton per 400-500 sq ft.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does El Paso Electric offer solar rebates?</h3><p>While El Paso Electric doesn't offer direct solar rebates, they provide full retail rate net metering at 11.3¢/kWh for excess solar energy fed back into the grid. This allows solar customers to receive credits for overproduction during sunny periods that offset usage during evening hours and winter months, effectively providing a 1:1 credit system for solar energy production.</p></div>

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much can I save with solar in El Paso?</h3><p>El Paso's exceptional solar irradiance allows systems to generate 1,500-1,700 kWh per kW annually. A typical 6kW system produces 9,000-10,200 kWh yearly, saving \$1,017-\$1,153 annually at 11.3¢/kWh rates. Most systems pay for themselves within 10-12 years and provide 25+ years of energy production, resulting in total lifetime savings of \$25,000-\$35,000.</p></div>
