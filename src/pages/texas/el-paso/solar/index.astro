const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in El Paso</h2>
<p>El Paso's hot-dry climate makes it an exceptional location for solar panel installations, with over 300 sunny days per year and abundant solar irradiance perfect for energy generation. The city's desert environment provides consistent, high-intensity sunlight throughout most of the year, allowing solar panels to operate at peak efficiency. With El Paso Electric's current residential electricity rate of 11.3¢ per kilowatt-hour, homeowners in this city of 678,815 residents have significant potential for long-term energy savings through solar adoption.</p>

<p>The hot-dry climate of El Paso County not only maximizes solar energy production but also creates ideal conditions for solar panel longevity, as the low humidity reduces corrosion risks and the minimal precipitation means less maintenance. El Paso Electric serves the region with traditional grid power, but the utility's net metering program allows solar customers to receive credits for excess energy their panels produce during peak sunlight hours. This combination of excellent solar conditions and favorable utility rates creates an attractive environment for residential and commercial solar installations throughout the El Paso metropolitan area.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in El Paso</h2>
<p>El Paso solar customers benefit from several attractive incentive programs that significantly reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit on the total system cost, including equipment and installation, which remains at 30% through 2032 before stepping down. While Texas doesn't offer state-level solar rebates, the state's lack of income tax means residents keep more of their solar savings. El Paso Electric participates in renewable energy programs and offers net metering, allowing customers to receive retail rate credits for excess solar energy fed back into the grid. Additionally, solar panel systems in Texas are exempt from state sales tax, and the added home value from solar installations is exempt from property tax increases, providing long-term financial benefits for El Paso homeowners.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in El Paso</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in El Paso, prioritize companies with proper Texas licensing, NABCEP-certified installers, and extensive experience in the local climate conditions. Look for contractors who offer comprehensive warranties covering panels (typically 20-25 years), inverters (10-25 years), and workmanship (minimum 10 years). The best El Paso solar companies will conduct thorough site assessments considering the city's intense summer heat, occasional dust storms, and roof orientation for optimal panel placement. Verify that potential installers are familiar with El Paso Electric's interconnection requirements and net metering procedures. Request multiple quotes, check Better Business Bureau ratings, read local customer reviews, and ensure the company provides detailed production estimates based on El Paso's specific solar irradiance data and your roof's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in El Paso</h2>
<p>Solar installations in El Paso typically achieve payback periods of 9-10 years, thanks to the combination of excellent solar resources and El Paso Electric's 11.3¢/kWh electricity rates. A typical 6kW system costing \$15,000 before incentives will generate approximately \$1,134 in annual electricity savings, resulting in over \$28,000 in total savings over 25 years after accounting for the initial investment. The hot-dry climate enables solar panels to produce 1,400-1,500 kWh per kW of installed capacity annually, significantly higher than the national average. With panel systems warranted for 25 years and often producing power for 30+ years, El Paso homeowners can expect total lifetime savings of \$35,000-\$50,000 from a typical residential installation. These calculations assume modest annual electricity rate increases of 2-3%, meaning actual savings could be substantially higher given historical utility rate trends.</p>
