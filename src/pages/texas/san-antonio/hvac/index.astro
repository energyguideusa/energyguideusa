const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in San Antonio</h2>
<p>San Antonio's hot-humid climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, with residents facing extreme summer temperatures often exceeding 100°F and high humidity levels that make cooling demands particularly intense. The city's 1,434,625 residents in Bexar County rely heavily on air conditioning from May through October, with cooling costs representing up to 60% of summer electricity bills. With CPS Energy's competitive rate of 10.2¢/kWh, San Antonio homeowners have a significant opportunity to reduce energy costs through efficient HVAC system selection and proper sizing.</p>

<p>The hot-humid climate requires HVAC systems that excel at both temperature control and humidity removal. Unlike dry climates where evaporative cooling might be effective, San Antonio's moisture-laden air demands refrigeration-based cooling systems with strong dehumidification capabilities. Modern high-efficiency systems with variable-speed technology are particularly well-suited for this environment, as they can run longer at lower speeds to remove humidity while maintaining comfortable temperatures. The relatively mild winters mean heating demands are minimal, making cooling efficiency the primary consideration for most San Antonio homeowners.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for San Antonio Climate</h2>
<p>For San Antonio's hot-humid climate, SEER ratings of 16 or higher are recommended, with 18-20 SEER systems providing optimal efficiency for the extended cooling season. Variable-speed air handlers are particularly valuable as they can operate at lower speeds for longer periods, effectively removing humidity while maintaining consistent temperatures. Heat pumps are excellent choices for San Antonio homes, providing efficient cooling in summer and adequate heating during the brief winter months when temperatures occasionally drop below 40°F. Two-stage or variable-speed compressors outperform single-stage units in humid climates by running longer cycles that better control moisture levels. Given that heating needs are minimal—typically only 2-3 months per year with mild temperatures—prioritizing cooling efficiency and humidity control should guide system selection over heating performance.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in San Antonio</h2>
<p>San Antonio residents can take advantage of multiple rebate programs to offset HVAC upgrade costs. Federal tax credits provide up to \$2,000 for qualifying high-efficiency heat pumps and up to \$600 for central air conditioners meeting specific efficiency requirements through 2032. CPS Energy offers substantial rebates for residential customers, including up to \$1,200 for high-efficiency heat pumps, \$800 for qualifying air conditioners, and additional incentives for smart thermostats and duct sealing services. The utility also provides free energy audits and weatherization assistance programs. Texas state programs occasionally offer additional incentives, particularly for Energy Star certified equipment. When combined, these rebates can reduce total system costs by \$1,500-3,000, significantly improving payback periods. To maximize savings, homeowners should verify current rebate availability and requirements with CPS Energy before making equipment purchases, as programs and amounts can change annually.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in San Antonio</h2>
<p>Selecting a qualified HVAC contractor in San Antonio requires verifying proper licensing through the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, as all HVAC contractors must hold valid state licenses and local permits. Look for contractors with extensive experience in hot-humid climates who understand the specific challenges of San Antonio's weather patterns and can properly size equipment for humidity control. Request multiple detailed quotes that include Manual J load calculations, ductwork evaluation, and equipment specifications. Reputable contractors should offer comprehensive warranties—typically 5-10 years on equipment and 1-2 years on installation labor. Verify insurance coverage and Better Business Bureau ratings, and prioritize contractors who are factory-authorized dealers for major brands, as this ensures access to warranty support and ongoing training. Emergency service availability is crucial given San Antonio's extreme summer heat, so choose contractors offering 24/7 repair services. Finally, ensure the contractor pulls proper permits and schedules required inspections, as unpermitted work can create liability issues and void equipment warranties.</p>
