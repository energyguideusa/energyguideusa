const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in San Antonio</h2>
<p>San Antonio's hot-humid climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, with summer temperatures regularly exceeding 95°F and humidity levels averaging 75-85%. The city's 1,434,625 residents in Bexar County rely heavily on air conditioning from April through October, making efficient cooling systems essential for comfort and manageable energy bills. With CPS Energy's electricity rate at 10.2¢/kWh, San Antonio homeowners can expect annual cooling costs between \$1,200-2,400 depending on home size and system efficiency.</p>

<p>The hot-humid climate requires HVAC systems that excel at both temperature control and moisture removal. Standard air conditioners must work harder in humid conditions, as they need to remove excess moisture before effectively cooling the air. This dual demand means San Antonio residents benefit significantly from high-efficiency systems with superior dehumidification capabilities. Proper system sizing and installation become critical factors, as oversized units may cool quickly but fail to adequately remove humidity, leading to uncomfortable indoor conditions despite lower temperatures.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for San Antonio Climate</h2>
<p>For San Antonio's hot-humid climate, homeowners should prioritize systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher and enhanced dehumidification capabilities. Variable-speed air conditioners perform exceptionally well in humid conditions, as they can run longer at lower speeds to remove moisture while maintaining consistent temperatures. Heat pumps offer excellent value for San Antonio homes, providing efficient cooling in summer and adequate heating during the mild winters when temperatures rarely drop below freezing. Two-stage compressors are particularly effective, operating at lower capacity during moderate weather and ramping up during peak summer heat. For optimal performance, systems should be paired with programmable thermostats and proper insulation to minimize the workload during San Antonio's extended cooling season that typically runs from late March through early November.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in San Antonio</h2>
<p>San Antonio homeowners can access multiple rebate programs to offset HVAC upgrade costs. CPS Energy offers rebates up to \$1,200 for qualifying high-efficiency air conditioning systems, with additional incentives for smart thermostats (\$85 rebate) and duct sealing services (\$400-800). The federal tax credit covers 30% of heat pump installation costs through 2032, potentially saving homeowners \$2,000-3,000 on qualifying systems. Texas also provides property tax exemptions for renewable energy systems, though traditional HVAC upgrades don't qualify. CPS Energy's Energy Efficiency Program includes free energy audits and financing options for approved upgrades, allowing customers to spread costs over several years at competitive interest rates. Combining federal credits with CPS Energy rebates can reduce total system costs by 25-40%, making high-efficiency upgrades more accessible for San Antonio residents.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in San Antonio</h2>
<p>Selecting a qualified HVAC contractor in San Antonio requires verification of proper licensing through the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, ensuring technicians hold current HVAC licenses and relevant certifications. Look for contractors with extensive experience in hot-humid climates who understand the specific challenges of moisture control and system sizing for San Antonio conditions. Reputable contractors should provide detailed written estimates, offer comprehensive warranties on both equipment and labor (minimum 5-year parts, 2-year labor), and maintain 24/7 emergency service capabilities during peak summer months. Check Better Business Bureau ratings, Google reviews, and ask for local references from recent installations. Established San Antonio HVAC companies should carry proper insurance, offer financing options, and provide ongoing maintenance programs to ensure optimal system performance. Avoid contractors who quote significantly below market rates, pressure for immediate decisions, or cannot provide proper licensing documentation and insurance certificates.</p>
