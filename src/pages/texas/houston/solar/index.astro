const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Houston</h2>
<p>Houston's hot-humid climate creates ideal conditions for solar energy generation, with the city receiving over 200 sunny days annually and abundant solar irradiance throughout the year. With Harris County's population of 2,304,580 residents facing electricity rates of 11.4¢/kWh through CenterPoint Energy, solar panels offer significant potential savings for homeowners. The consistent high temperatures and intense summer sun in Houston make solar installations particularly effective, as panels can generate substantial energy output even during the challenging Gulf Coast weather patterns.</p>

<p>CenterPoint Energy's service area covers much of the Greater Houston region, and their 11.4¢/kWh rate structure makes solar particularly attractive for residential customers. The hot-humid climate means Houston homeowners typically run air conditioning systems extensively from May through October, creating high electricity bills that solar panels can dramatically reduce. Professional solar installers in Houston understand the unique challenges of the local climate, including proper ventilation systems to handle humidity and mounting techniques that withstand Gulf Coast storms and hurricane-force winds.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Houston</h2>
<p>Houston solar customers benefit from the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which provides a 30% tax credit on the total system cost through 2032, then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Texas offers property tax exemptions for solar installations, meaning the added value to your home from solar panels won't increase your property tax burden. While CenterPoint Energy doesn't currently offer direct solar rebates, they do provide net metering programs that allow customers to sell excess energy back to the grid at retail rates. Additionally, Harris County and some municipalities offer expedited permitting processes for solar installations, reducing installation timeframes and associated costs for homeowners.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Houston</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in Houston, prioritize companies with NABCEP-certified installers and extensive experience with Texas's hot-humid climate conditions. Look for contractors who hold proper Texas electrical licenses and are familiar with Harris County permitting requirements and CenterPoint interconnection procedures. Top Houston solar companies should offer comprehensive warranties including 25-year panel performance warranties, 10-year equipment warranties, and workmanship guarantees of at least 5 years. Verify that potential installers carry adequate insurance, have strong Better Business Bureau ratings, and can provide local references from recent installations. Companies experienced in Gulf Coast weather patterns will understand proper mounting techniques, adequate ventilation systems, and hurricane-resistant installation methods crucial for long-term system performance.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Houston</h2>
<p>Based on Houston's 11.4¢/kWh electricity rates and average annual solar irradiance of 4.5 peak sun hours daily, typical residential solar systems achieve payback periods between 13-14 years. A 6kW system generating approximately 8,400 kWh annually provides savings of nearly \$958 per year at current CenterPoint rates. Over a 25-year system lifespan, Houston homeowners can expect total savings between \$18,000-\$24,000 after accounting for the initial investment and federal tax credits. With electricity rates historically increasing 2-3% annually, actual savings will likely exceed these conservative estimates. The combination of abundant sunshine, high cooling costs, and reasonable installation costs makes Houston one of the more attractive solar markets in Texas, with many systems providing positive cash flow within the first year after the payback period ends.</p>
