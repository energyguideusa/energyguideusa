const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Houston, Texas</h2>
<p>Houston's hot-humid climate makes it an ideal location for both solar energy generation and high-efficiency HVAC systems. With over 2.3 million residents in Harris County, the city enjoys abundant sunshine year-round, providing excellent conditions for solar panel production. The combination of high electricity rates at 11.4¢/kWh through CenterPoint Energy and substantial cooling demands creates significant opportunities for homeowners to reduce their energy costs through smart solar and HVAC investments.</p>

<p>The city's average home size of 2,400 square feet means substantial energy consumption, particularly during Houston's long, hot summers when air conditioning runs continuously. CenterPoint Energy serves the greater Houston area with reliable grid infrastructure that supports net metering, allowing solar panel owners to sell excess electricity back to the utility. This creates a perfect storm of conditions where solar panels can dramatically offset high cooling costs while HVAC upgrades can improve comfort and efficiency in the challenging Gulf Coast climate.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in Houston reflect the competitive Texas market, with installed prices averaging \$2.70 per watt before incentives. The 30% federal tax credit significantly reduces upfront costs, while CenterPoint's net metering program ensures homeowners receive full retail credit for excess solar production. With Houston's average of 4.8 peak sun hours daily, a typical 6kW system generates approximately 9,600 kWh annually, providing substantial savings on electric bills that often exceed \$200 monthly during peak summer months.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Houston</h2>
<p>Houston's hot-humid climate demands robust HVAC systems capable of handling extreme heat and humidity from May through October. The ideal system for Houston homes should feature a minimum SEER rating of 16-18, with high-efficiency units rated at SEER 20+ providing optimal performance and energy savings. Central air conditioning with variable-speed compressors works exceptionally well in Houston's climate, as these systems can modulate output to maintain consistent temperatures while effectively managing humidity levels that regularly exceed 70%.</p>

<p>Heat pumps are increasingly popular in Houston due to mild winter temperatures, offering year-round efficiency with SEER ratings up to 22 and HSPF ratings of 10+. For the city's 2,400 square foot average homes, a 3.5-4 ton system typically provides adequate cooling capacity. Smart thermostats are essential in Houston's climate, allowing homeowners to optimize comfort while managing the high cooling loads that can represent 60-70% of annual electricity consumption. Proper ductwork design and regular maintenance become critical in the humid environment to prevent mold growth and maintain indoor air quality.</p>

<h2>Houston Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Houston residents benefit from multiple layers of solar incentives that significantly reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on total system costs through 2032, stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Texas offers additional advantages through its lack of state income tax and property tax exemptions for solar installations, meaning the added home value from solar panels won't increase property tax assessments.</p>

<p>CenterPoint Energy participates in Texas's net metering program, crediting solar customers at full retail rates for excess electricity fed back into the grid. The utility also offers rebates for high-efficiency HVAC systems, with rebates up to \$1,200 for SEER 16+ air conditioners and up to \$1,800 for qualifying heat pumps. Harris County occasionally provides additional rebates for energy efficiency improvements, while federal tax credits also apply to qualifying HVAC systems, heat pumps, and smart thermostats when installed with solar systems.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Houston</h2>
<p>Houston's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. In upscale areas like River Oaks and Memorial, larger homes often require 8-10kW solar systems and high-capacity HVAC units, with homeowners prioritizing premium equipment and aesthetics. The Heights and Montrose feature many historic homes that may need electrical upgrades for solar installations, while the dense tree canopy requires careful panel placement to avoid shading issues.</p>

<p>Suburban communities like Katy, Sugar Land, and The Woodlands typically feature newer construction with optimal roof orientations for solar panels and modern electrical systems. These areas often have HOA restrictions that may influence solar panel placement and appearance. Inner-city neighborhoods like EaDo and Midtown are seeing increased solar adoption among younger residents, with smaller systems suitable for townhomes and condominiums. Flood-prone areas near Buffalo Bayou and Brays Bayou require elevated HVAC equipment and careful electrical planning for solar installations to meet local building codes.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Houston</h2>
