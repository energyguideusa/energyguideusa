const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Corpus Christi</h2>
<p>Corpus Christi's hot-humid climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, with residents experiencing intense summer heat combined with high moisture levels from the Gulf Coast. The city's 326,586 residents in Nueces County rely heavily on air conditioning systems that must work overtime from April through October, when temperatures regularly exceed 85°F and humidity levels often reach 80-90%. This demanding climate requires HVAC systems with superior dehumidification capabilities and high-efficiency ratings to maintain indoor comfort while managing energy costs.</p>

<p>With electricity rates at 11.8¢/kWh through AEP Texas, Corpus Christi homeowners face significant cooling costs that can account for 60-70% of their summer electric bills. The hot-humid climate means HVAC systems must not only cool the air but also remove substantial moisture, making proper sizing and efficiency ratings critical for cost-effective operation. Systems that are undersized will struggle with humidity control, while oversized units will short-cycle and fail to adequately dehumidify, leading to comfort issues and higher energy bills throughout the extended cooling season.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Corpus Christi Climate</h2>
<p>For Corpus Christi's hot-humid climate, HVAC systems should have a minimum SEER rating of 16, with 18+ SEER units providing optimal efficiency and humidity control. Variable-speed air handlers are particularly beneficial, as they run longer at lower speeds to maintain consistent temperatures and superior dehumidification. Heat pumps are excellent choices for the Gulf Coast, providing efficient cooling in summer and adequate heating during mild winters when temperatures rarely drop below freezing. Two-stage or variable-speed compressors work best in humid climates, as they can run longer cycles at reduced capacity to remove moisture effectively. Since heating needs are minimal—typically only 2-3 months per year with average winter lows in the 40s—cooling efficiency and humidity control should be the primary considerations when selecting equipment.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Corpus Christi</h2>
<p>Corpus Christi residents can take advantage of multiple rebate programs to offset HVAC installation costs. Federal tax credits offer up to \$2,000 for qualifying heat pumps and up to \$1,200 for high-efficiency air conditioners installed through 2032. AEP Texas provides rebates ranging from \$300-800 for ENERGY STAR certified systems, with additional incentives for smart thermostats (\$50-100) and duct sealing services. The City of Corpus Christi occasionally offers energy efficiency programs through partnerships with local utilities, providing additional rebates for qualifying improvements. Texas also participates in federal weatherization assistance programs for qualifying low-income households, potentially covering entire HVAC system replacements. Combining federal tax credits with utility rebates can reduce total installation costs by \$1,500-3,000, significantly improving payback periods for high-efficiency systems.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Corpus Christi</h2>
<p>When selecting an HVAC contractor in Corpus Christi, verify they hold proper Texas licensing through the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) and carry adequate insurance coverage. Look for contractors with specific experience in hot-humid climates who understand the importance of proper system sizing and humidity control. Request multiple detailed quotes that include equipment specifications, labor costs, and warranty information. Reputable contractors should perform Manual J load calculations to properly size equipment and discuss ductwork inspection and sealing. Check Better Business Bureau ratings, Google reviews, and ask for local references from recent customers. Emergency service availability is crucial in Corpus Christi's climate, so choose contractors offering 24/7 emergency repairs with reasonable response times. Ensure warranties cover both equipment and installation work, with minimum 5-year coverage on major components and 1-2 years on labor.</p>
