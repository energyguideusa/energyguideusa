const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Corpus Christi</h2>
<p>Corpus Christi's hot-humid climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems serving the city's 326,586 residents in Nueces County. With average summer temperatures reaching 95°F and humidity levels consistently above 70%, air conditioning systems work overtime for nearly eight months of the year. The coastal location means HVAC units must also withstand salt air corrosion while maintaining peak efficiency during extended cooling seasons that can run from April through October.</p>

<p>Energy costs are a significant consideration for Corpus Christi homeowners, with AEP Texas charging an average of 11.8¢/kWh for electricity. A typical 2,000 square foot home can expect annual cooling costs between \$1,200-\$1,800, making system efficiency crucial for long-term savings. The high humidity also means your HVAC system must excel at dehumidification, not just temperature control, to maintain indoor comfort and prevent mold growth common in coastal Texas environments.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Corpus Christi Climate</h2>
<p>For Corpus Christi's hot-humid climate, high-efficiency systems with superior dehumidification capabilities are essential. A minimum 16 SEER rating is recommended, but 18-20 SEER units provide optimal performance in the demanding coastal environment. Variable-speed air handlers excel here, running longer at lower speeds to remove more humidity while maintaining consistent temperatures. Heat pumps are particularly effective since heating needs are minimal - typically only 2-3 months per year with mild winter temperatures rarely dropping below 40°F. Two-stage or variable-capacity systems handle the extreme summer heat more efficiently than single-stage units, while providing better humidity control during milder spring and fall months when cooling loads vary significantly.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Corpus Christi</h2>
<p>Corpus Christi residents can access multiple rebate programs to offset HVAC upgrade costs. Federal tax credits provide up to \$2,000 for qualifying high-efficiency heat pumps and up to \$600 for central air conditioners meeting ENERGY STAR Most Efficient criteria. AEP Texas offers rebates up to \$1,000 for residential customers installing qualifying high-efficiency systems, with specific incentives for heat pumps and smart thermostats. The City of Corpus Christi periodically offers weatherization assistance programs for qualifying homeowners, and the Texas State Energy Conservation Office provides low-interest financing for energy-efficient upgrades. Additional manufacturer rebates from brands like Trane, Carrier, and Lennox can add \$300-800 in savings when combined with utility programs, potentially reducing total system costs by \$2,000-4,000.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Corpus Christi</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in Corpus Christi requires verifying Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) certification and local business permits. Look for contractors with specific experience in coastal installations who understand salt air corrosion protection and humidity control requirements. Established local companies typically offer better warranty service and emergency response - crucial during summer heat waves when system failures become urgent. Request detailed load calculations using Manual J protocols, as proper sizing is critical in humid climates. Quality contractors should offer comprehensive warranties covering both parts and labor for 5-10 years, provide 24/7 emergency service during peak season, and demonstrate knowledge of local utility rebate programs to maximize your savings.</p>
