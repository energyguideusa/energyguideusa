const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Corpus Christi, Texas</h2>
<p>Corpus Christi's coastal location and abundant sunshine make it an ideal market for solar energy systems. With over 230 sunny days per year and an average of 5.5 peak sun hours daily, homeowners in this Nueces County city can generate substantial electricity from rooftop solar panels. The hot-humid climate drives up cooling costs significantly, making energy efficiency improvements particularly valuable for the city's 326,586 residents.</p>

<p>AEP Texas serves the Corpus Christi area with electricity rates averaging 11.8¢ per kWh, which is slightly below the Texas average but still provides solid savings potential for solar adopters. The combination of high cooling loads in the hot-humid climate and reasonable electricity rates creates an excellent opportunity for homeowners to reduce their energy bills through strategic solar and HVAC upgrades. With average home sizes of 1,980 square feet, most Corpus Christi residents can achieve significant energy independence with properly sized solar and efficient HVAC systems.</p>

<p>Solar panel installation costs in Corpus Christi typically range from \$3.00 to \$3.50 per watt before incentives, which is competitive with Texas averages. The annual savings calculations above are based on AEP Texas's 11.8¢/kWh rate and assume optimal south-facing roof orientation. Most 1,980 square foot homes in Corpus Christi will benefit from 6kW to 8kW systems to offset their high summer cooling loads. With the 30% federal tax credit, payback periods typically range from 8 to 11 years, making solar a solid long-term investment for homeowners.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Corpus Christi</h2>
<p>Corpus Christi's hot-humid climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, requiring equipment that can handle both high temperatures and moisture removal. The coastal location means summer temperatures regularly reach the mid-90s with high humidity levels, creating cooling loads that can stress inefficient systems. For this climate zone, homeowners should prioritize high-efficiency central air conditioning systems with SEER ratings of at least 16, though SEER 18-20 units provide the best long-term value given the extensive cooling season.</p>

<p>Heat pumps are particularly well-suited for Corpus Christi because the mild winter temperatures rarely require backup heating. Variable-speed heat pump systems excel in humid climates because they run longer at lower speeds, providing better dehumidification than single-stage units. Proper sizing is critical – oversized units will short-cycle and fail to remove humidity effectively. For the average 1,980 square foot home, a 3 to 4-ton system typically provides adequate cooling capacity. Ductwork should be properly sealed and insulated, as leaky ducts in hot attics can reduce system efficiency by 20-30%.</p>

<h2>Corpus Christi Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Corpus Christi residents have access to several valuable energy incentives that can significantly reduce the cost of solar and HVAC upgrades. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit for solar panel installations through 2032, then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the total system cost including panels, inverters, mounting equipment, and installation labor. For a typical \$18,000 solar installation, the federal credit reduces the net cost to \$12,600.</p>

<p>Texas does not have a state income tax, so there are no additional state solar tax credits, but the state does offer property tax exemptions for solar installations. AEP Texas participates in various energy efficiency rebate programs, including rebates for high-efficiency HVAC equipment, smart thermostats, and weatherization improvements. The utility also offers net metering for solar customers, allowing excess electricity to be credited to future bills at the retail rate. Additionally, Corpus Christi often qualifies for federal weatherization assistance programs and PACE financing options that can help homeowners fund energy improvements with no upfront costs.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Corpus Christi</h2>
<p>Corpus Christi's diverse neighborhoods each present unique opportunities and considerations for solar and HVAC installations. The Padre Island area, with its newer construction and larger lots, often features homes ideal for solar installations with minimal shading issues. However, the coastal location requires solar mounting systems rated for high wind speeds due to hurricane exposure. The King Crossing and Flour Bluff neighborhoods contain many mid-century homes that may benefit from HVAC upgrades and ductwork improvements before adding solar.</p>

<p>Downtown and the Bay Area neighborhoods feature a mix of historic homes and modern condominiums, where solar installations may require additional permitting considerations due to historic district regulations. The Annaville and Calallen areas, being slightly inland, experience marginally lower humidity levels but still require robust cooling systems. Homes in the Southside and Westside neighborhoods often have mature tree coverage that may require selective trimming to optimize solar production, but the shade can also reduce HVAC cooling loads during peak summer months.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Corpus Christi</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in Corpus Christi?</h3><p>Solar panel installations in Corpus Christi typically cost between \$15,000-\$24,000 before the federal tax credit, depending on system size.

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Best HVAC for Corpus Christi climate?</h3><p>Variable-speed heat pumps with SEER ratings of 16-20 are ideal for Corpus Christi's hot-humid climate. These systems provide excellent dehumidification while maintaining energy efficiency during the long cooling season. Proper sizing (typically 3-4 tons for average homes) and sealed ductwork are crucial for optimal performance in the coastal humidity.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does AEP Texas offer solar rebates?</h3><p>While AEP Texas doesn't offer direct solar rebates, they do provide net metering that credits excess solar production at retail rates. The utility offers rebates for energy-efficient HVAC equipment and smart thermostats that pair well with solar installations. Combined with the federal 30% tax credit and Texas property tax exemptions for solar, homeowners can achieve substantial savings.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How long is the payback period for solar in Corpus Christi?</h3><p>Solar payback periods in Corpus Christi typically range from 8-11 years, depending on system size, energy usage, and available incentives. The combination of high solar irradiance (5.5 peak sun hours daily), reasonable electricity rates at 11.8¢/kWh, and substantial cooling loads creates favorable economics for solar investment.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Do I need special equipment for coastal solar installations?</h3><p>Yes, solar installations in Corpus Christi should use mounting systems and panels rated for high wind speeds due to hurricane exposure. Corrosion-resistant materials are also recommended given the salt air environment. Proper installation by experienced local contractors familiar with coastal conditions is essential for long-term system reliability.</p></div>
