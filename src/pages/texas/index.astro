<h2>Texas Incentives & Rebates</h2>
<p>Texas homeowners have access to several valuable incentives that significantly reduce the cost of solar panel and HVAC system installations. The federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit for solar installations through 2032, with the credit stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the total system cost, including equipment, installation, and permitting, making it one of the most valuable solar incentives available.</p>

<p>At the state level, Texas offers a property tax exemption for solar energy systems, meaning the added value of a solar installation will not increase property tax assessments. This exemption applies to both residential and commercial solar installations and remains in effect for the life of the system. Additionally, Texas has no state income tax, which means homeowners can fully benefit from federal tax credits without state tax complications.</p>

<p>Oncor, as the primary transmission and distribution utility serving much of Texas, offers various energy efficiency programs and rebates for HVAC system upgrades. These programs typically provide rebates of \$300-800 for high-efficiency air conditioning systems and heat pumps that meet specific SEER rating requirements. Many local utility companies and electric cooperatives throughout Texas also offer additional rebates and incentive programs for both solar installations and energy-efficient HVAC systems, creating stacked savings opportunities for homeowners.</p>

<p>Some municipalities and counties in Texas provide additional solar incentives, including expedited permitting processes and reduced permit fees. The Austin Energy solar rebate program and CPS Energy in San Antonio have historically offered some of the most generous local solar incentives in the state, though availability and amounts vary by location and program funding.</p>
