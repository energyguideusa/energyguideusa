const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Bellevue, Nebraska</h2>
<p>Bellevue, Nebraska, with its population of 64,176 residents in Sarpy County, presents an excellent opportunity for homeowners to invest in solar panels and efficient HVAC systems. The city's cold continental climate creates significant heating demands during winter months, making energy efficiency a top priority for the average 1,820 square foot homes throughout the community. With OPPD (Omaha Public Power District) serving as the primary utility provider and electricity rates at 11.0¢/kWh, residents have a solid foundation for calculating solar savings and energy efficiency improvements.</p>

<p>The combination of Nebraska's generous solar incentives, federal tax credits, and OPPD's net metering program makes Bellevue an attractive market for renewable energy adoption. While the cold climate means solar panels actually operate more efficiently during cooler months, the moderate electricity rates provide a reasonable baseline for calculating return on investment. Additionally, the cold winters create opportunities for homeowners to pair solar installations with high-efficiency heat pumps or hybrid heating systems, maximizing both comfort and energy savings throughout the year.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in Bellevue average between \$3.10 to \$3.50 per watt installed, which is competitive with national averages. The calculations above factor in Nebraska's excellent solar resource potential, with the state receiving approximately 4.5 peak sun hours daily. OPPD's net metering program allows homeowners to receive credit for excess power generated, making these systems particularly attractive for properly sized installations. Most Bellevue homes with average energy consumption will benefit from a 6-8kW system, providing optimal coverage for annual electricity needs while maximizing the federal tax credit benefits.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Bellevue</h2>
<p>Bellevue's cold climate requires robust heating systems capable of maintaining comfort during harsh Nebraska winters, where temperatures can drop well below freezing for extended periods. For optimal performance in this climate, homeowners should consider high-efficiency furnaces with AFUE ratings of 90% or higher, paired with central air conditioning systems rated at minimum 16 SEER for cooling efficiency. Heat pump systems can work in Bellevue but require cold-climate models or hybrid systems that switch to backup heating when temperatures drop below 25°F, which occurs frequently during winter months.</p>

<p>The most popular HVAC solutions for Bellevue's 1,820 square foot average homes include variable-speed gas furnaces paired with high-efficiency air conditioners, providing year-round comfort with lower operating costs. Ductless mini-split systems are gaining popularity for additions and specific zones, offering SEER ratings up to 25+ for cooling and HSPF ratings of 10+ for heating. When combined with solar panel systems, homeowners can achieve significant energy independence, especially during shoulder seasons when heating and cooling demands are moderate and solar production is strong.</p>

<h2>Bellevue Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Bellevue residents have access to several attractive incentives that make solar and HVAC upgrades more affordable. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on total system costs through 2032, then stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Nebraska offers additional state-level incentives, including property tax exemptions for solar installations, meaning the added home value from solar panels won't increase property taxes. The state also provides sales tax exemptions on solar equipment purchases, saving homeowners an additional 5.5% on system costs.</p>

<p>OPPD offers net metering for solar customers, allowing excess generation to be credited at retail rates, effectively using the grid as a battery. Additionally, OPPD provides rebates for high-efficiency HVAC equipment, including up to \$850 for ENERGY STAR qualified central air conditioners and up to \$1,200 for high-efficiency heat pumps. The utility also offers rebates for smart thermostats (\$75) and duct sealing services, helping homeowners optimize their overall energy efficiency when upgrading systems.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Bellevue</h2>
<p>Bellevue's diverse neighborhoods each present unique opportunities for solar and HVAC installations. The historic Olde Towne area features mature trees that may require careful solar panel positioning to avoid shading issues, while the established homes often benefit from HVAC system upgrades to improve efficiency. Newer developments like Prairie Creek and Harvest Hills typically have optimal roof orientations for solar installations and may already feature higher-efficiency HVAC systems, making solar additions particularly attractive for maximizing energy savings.</p>

<p>The Fontenelle Forest area neighborhoods often feature larger lots with less shading, ideal for ground-mounted solar systems or expansive rooftop installations. Near Offutt Air Force Base, homes may have specific architectural considerations, but the stable community provides excellent conditions for long-term solar investments. Western Bellevue developments often feature newer construction with modern electrical systems that easily accommodate solar installations, while eastern areas closer to the Missouri River may require additional consideration for humidity control in HVAC system selection.</p>
