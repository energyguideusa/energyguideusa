const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Nebraska presents an excellent opportunity for both solar energy installations and HVAC system upgrades, offering homeowners significant potential for energy savings and environmental benefits. With an average of 4.8 sun hours per day, Nebraska receives substantial solar irradiance throughout the year, making it a surprisingly viable state for solar panel installations. The state's relatively affordable electricity rates at 10.8¢ per kilowatt-hour, primarily served by Omaha Public Power District and other regional utilities, provide a solid baseline for calculating solar savings and return on investment.</p>

<p>Nebraska's continental climate, characterized by hot summers and cold winters, creates substantial energy demands for both heating and cooling systems. This climate pattern makes the state particularly well-suited for energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy adoption. Summer temperatures regularly exceed 85°F, while winter temperatures frequently drop below freezing, resulting in significant HVAC usage throughout much of the year. The combination of abundant sunshine, moderate electricity rates, and high energy usage creates ideal conditions for solar panel installations that can substantially reduce utility bills.</p>

<p>The state's energy landscape is further enhanced by various incentive programs, including federal tax credits, state-level financing options, and utility rebate programs. Nebraska homeowners can take advantage of the federal 30% solar investment tax credit, along with local utility incentives that can reduce the overall cost of solar installations by thousands of dollars. When combined with modern HVAC systems featuring high efficiency ratings, Nebraska residents can achieve remarkable energy savings while reducing their carbon footprint and increasing property values.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in Nebraska</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Nebraska's solar resource potential is stronger than many residents realize, with the state receiving between 4.5 to 5.2 peak sun hours daily depending on location and season. The eastern regions, including Omaha and Lincoln, typically see slightly lower irradiance levels due to increased cloud cover, while western Nebraska enjoys some of the state's best solar conditions. During peak summer months, solar panels can produce up to 6-7 hours of peak equivalent sunshine daily, while winter production typically ranges from 3-4 hours due to shorter days and occasional snow cover.</p>

<p>A typical 6kW residential solar system in Nebraska can generate approximately 7,200-8,400 kWh annually, which covers 70-90% of an average household's electricity needs. Seasonal variations show peak production occurring from May through August, when long days and intense sunshine combine to maximize output. Winter production, while lower, remains substantial enough to provide meaningful electricity generation even during Nebraska's coldest months. Modern solar panels perform efficiently in cold temperatures, and snow typically slides off tilted panels or melts quickly due to the dark surface absorption.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems in Nebraska</h2>

<h3>Climate Considerations</h3>
<p>Nebraska's continental climate demands HVAC systems capable of handling extreme temperature variations, with summer highs reaching 100°F and winter lows dropping to -20°F or below. The state experiences approximately 6,600 heating degree days and 1,200 cooling degree days annually, indicating that heating requirements significantly outweigh cooling needs. This climate profile makes heat pumps an increasingly attractive option, particularly newer cold-climate models that maintain efficiency even at sub-zero temperatures.</p>

<p>For cooling systems, a minimum SEER rating of 14-16 is recommended for Nebraska homes, though systems with SEER ratings of 18-20 provide optimal efficiency and comfort during peak summer months. Heating systems should prioritize high Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) ratings of 90% or higher for gas furnaces, or Heating Seasonal Performance Factor (HSPF) ratings above 9.0 for heat pump systems. Proper sizing and installation are crucial in Nebraska's variable climate, as oversized systems can lead to inefficient operation and poor humidity control during milder weather periods.</p>

<h2>Nebraska Incentives & Rebates</h2>
<p>Nebraska offers several attractive incentive programs that significantly reduce the cost of solar panel installations and energy-efficient HVAC systems. Understanding and properly utilizing these programs can save homeowners thousands of dollars on their energy upgrade projects.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Federal 30% Solar Tax Credit:</strong> The federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) allows homeowners to deduct 30% of the total cost of solar panel installation from their federal taxes. This credit applies to the full system cost, including equipment, installation, and permitting fees. For a \$15,000 solar installation, this translates to \$4,500 in tax savings. The credit can be carried forward to future tax years if the homeowner's tax liability is insufficient in the installation year.</li>

<li><strong>Dollar and Energy Saving Loans:</strong> Nebraska offers low-interest financing through the Dollar and Energy Saving Loan program, providing loans up to \$7,500 for energy efficiency improvements including HVAC upgrades and solar installations. Interest rates are typically 3-5% below market rates, with terms up to 10 years. This program is administered through participating banks and credit unions statewide.</li>

<li><strong>Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) Programs:</strong> OPPD offers substantial rebates for energy-efficient equipment, including up to \$800 for high-efficiency air conditioners and heat pumps, and \$400-600 rebates for Energy Star certified furnaces. OPPD also provides net metering for solar customers, allowing excess electricity to be sold back to the grid at retail rates, typically credited on monthly bills.</li>

<li><strong>Local Utility Rebates:</strong> Many Nebraska utilities offer additional rebate programs. Lincoln Electric System provides rebates up to \$500 for heat pump installations and offers time-of-use rates that can benefit solar customers. Smaller municipal utilities often have their own incentive programs, with some offering cash rebates for solar installations ranging from \$500-1,500 per system.</li>

<li><strong>Maximizing Incentive Value:</strong> To optimize savings, homeowners should coordinate solar and HVAC installations to take advantage of multiple programs simultaneously. Installing high-efficiency HVAC systems before adding solar panels can reduce overall electricity needs, allowing for smaller, more cost-effective solar installations while still achieving significant energy independence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Major Cities in Nebraska</h2>
