const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Pittsburgh</h2>
<p>Pittsburgh's transition to solar energy presents unique opportunities despite the city's cold climate and reputation for cloudy skies. With Duquesne Light serving the majority of Pittsburgh's 302,971 residents at an electricity rate of 12.8¢/kWh, homeowners are finding that solar panels can provide significant long-term savings even in Pennsylvania's challenging weather conditions. Modern solar technology performs efficiently in cold temperatures, and Pittsburgh receives approximately 4.2 peak sun hours daily on average, making solar installations viable for the Steel City.</p>

<p>The cold climate actually works in favor of solar panel efficiency, as photovoltaic cells operate more effectively in cooler temperatures compared to extreme heat. While Pittsburgh experiences fewer sunny days than southwestern states, the combination of reasonable electricity rates from Duquesne Light and available incentives creates favorable economics for solar adoption. Snow typically slides off angled panels naturally, and the reflective properties of snow can actually boost energy production during winter months when the sun is shining.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Pittsburgh</h2>
<p>Pittsburgh residents can take advantage of substantial solar incentives that significantly reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit on the total system cost, including equipment and installation, through 2032. This credit steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034 before expiring for residential installations. Pennsylvania offers additional support through net metering policies that allow Duquesne Light customers to receive retail rate credits for excess solar energy fed back into the grid. While Pennsylvania doesn't currently offer statewide solar rebates, some local programs and utility-specific incentives may be available. Property tax exemptions for solar installations mean the added home value from solar panels won't increase your property taxes, and solar equipment is exempt from Pennsylvania's 6% sales tax.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Pittsburgh</h2>
<p>Selecting the right solar installer in Pittsburgh requires careful evaluation of several key factors. Look for companies with proper licensing through the Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry and certifications from the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP). Experienced Pittsburgh installers understand local building codes, permit requirements, and how to optimize system performance in the region's climate conditions. Verify that installers carry adequate insurance and offer comprehensive warranties covering both equipment (typically 20-25 years for panels) and workmanship (minimum 10 years). Request multiple quotes, check Better Business Bureau ratings, and review customer testimonials specifically from Pittsburgh-area installations. The best installers will provide detailed energy production estimates based on your home's specific orientation, shading conditions, and historical weather data for the Pittsburgh area.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Pittsburgh</h2>
<p>The return on investment for solar panels in Pittsburgh is compelling when analyzed over the system's 25-year lifespan. With Duquesne Light's current rate of 12.8¢/kWh and typical annual electricity cost increases of 2-3%, a properly sized solar system pays for itself in approximately 13-14 years. A 6kW system costing \$13,020 after the federal tax credit can generate estimated lifetime savings of \$18,500-\$22,000 over 25 years, accounting for modest utility rate increases. The payback period improves if electricity rates rise faster than projected or if additional incentives become available. Beyond financial returns, solar panels increase home values by an average of 3-4% while providing energy independence and reducing carbon footprint. Pittsburgh's commitment to renewable energy goals also suggests potential future benefits for early solar adopters through possible utility programs or city initiatives.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="space-y-4 my-6">
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">How much do solar panels cost in Pittsburgh?</h3>
