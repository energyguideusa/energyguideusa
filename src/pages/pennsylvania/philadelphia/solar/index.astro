const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Philadelphia</h2>
<p>Philadelphia's growing population of 1,603,797 residents is increasingly turning to solar energy as a smart financial investment. With PECO electricity rates at 13.9¢/kWh, homeowners are finding that solar panels can significantly reduce their monthly utility bills while contributing to Pennsylvania's clean energy goals. The city's cold-mixed climate provides excellent conditions for solar energy production, with panels actually performing more efficiently in cooler temperatures despite common misconceptions about needing constant sunshine.</p>

<p>Philadelphia County receives an average of 4.2 peak sun hours per day annually, making it well-suited for solar installations. The cold-mixed climate means residents experience distinct seasons, but modern solar panels are designed to withstand temperature fluctuations and continue generating power even on cloudy days. PECO's net metering program allows Philadelphia homeowners to sell excess power back to the grid, further enhancing the financial benefits of going solar in the City of Brotherly Love.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Philadelphia</h2>
<p>Philadelphia residents can take advantage of multiple solar incentives that make installation more affordable. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit on the total system cost through 2032, then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Pennsylvania offers additional state-level incentives including Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs), which allow homeowners to sell certificates for the clean energy they produce. PECO participates in Pennsylvania's net metering program, crediting customers for excess solar energy fed back into the grid at the full retail rate of 13.9¢/kWh. The city also offers expedited permitting processes for solar installations, reducing installation timelines and costs for Philadelphia homeowners.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Philadelphia</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in Philadelphia, look for companies with proper Pennsylvania licensing, NABCEP-certified installers, and extensive local experience navigating Philadelphia's permitting process. Top contractors should offer comprehensive warranties covering equipment (typically 20-25 years for panels, 10-12 years for inverters) and workmanship (minimum 10 years). Reputable Philadelphia solar companies will provide detailed energy production estimates based on your specific roof orientation, shading, and local weather patterns. Check Better Business Bureau ratings, Google reviews, and ask for references from recent Philadelphia installations. Ensure your chosen installer handles all permitting with Philadelphia's Department of Licenses and Inspections and coordinates utility interconnection with PECO.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Philadelphia</h2>
<p>Philadelphia homeowners typically see solar payback periods of 11-12 years based on current PECO rates of 13.9¢/kWh and average system costs. Over 25 years, a typical 6kW system costing \$12,600 after federal tax credits can generate approximately \$26,700 in electricity savings, resulting in a net profit of \$14,100. This calculation assumes a modest 2% annual increase in electricity rates, meaning actual savings could be higher as PECO rates rise over time. Philadelphia's cold-mixed climate helps panels operate efficiently, and the lack of extreme heat extends equipment lifespan. With PECO's full retail net metering and Pennsylvania's SREC program potentially providing additional income, Philadelphia solar installations often exceed projected returns, making them one of the most reliable long-term investments homeowners can make.</p>
