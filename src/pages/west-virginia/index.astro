const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>West Virginia presents a compelling opportunity for homeowners considering solar panel installation and HVAC system upgrades. Despite its mountainous terrain and reputation for coal production, the Mountain State receives approximately 3.8 average sun hours per day, providing sufficient solar irradiance for effective energy generation. With electricity rates averaging 11.7 cents per kilowatt-hour through the primary utility provider Appalachian Power, West Virginians face energy costs that make solar investment increasingly attractive as a long-term financial strategy.</p>

<p>The state's unique geographic position in the Mid-Atlantic region creates distinct seasonal energy demands that make both solar panels and efficient HVAC systems particularly valuable investments. West Virginia's continental climate features cold winters requiring substantial heating and warm, humid summers necessitating reliable air conditioning. This seasonal variation, combined with the state's moderate solar resource and available federal and state incentives, creates an ideal environment for homeowners to reduce their energy dependency through renewable energy generation and high-efficiency climate control systems.</p>

<p>Appalachian Power, serving approximately 460,000 customers across West Virginia, has implemented net metering policies that allow solar panel owners to receive credit for excess electricity generated and fed back into the grid. This regulatory framework, combined with the federal solar Investment Tax Credit and West Virginia's property tax exemption for solar installations, creates multiple layers of financial incentive for residents considering the transition to clean energy and efficient home systems.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in West Virginia</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>West Virginia's solar resource potential varies significantly across the state due to its mountainous topography and varying elevations. The eastern panhandle regions, including Jefferson and Berkeley counties, typically receive the highest solar irradiance levels, approaching 4.2 to 4.5 peak sun hours daily. Central regions around Charleston and Huntington average 3.6 to 3.9 peak sun hours, while the mountainous northern and southern counties may see slightly reduced solar potential due to terrain shading and increased cloud cover.</p>

<p>A typical residential solar installation in West Virginia can expect to generate approximately 1,100 to 1,300 kWh per installed kilowatt annually. This means a 6kW system, common for average-sized homes, would produce between 6,600 and 7,800 kWh per year. Given that the average West Virginia household consumes approximately 12,000 kWh annually, a properly sized solar array can offset 50-65% of typical residential electricity usage, providing substantial savings on monthly utility bills while reducing dependence on grid-supplied power.</p>

<p>The state's seasonal solar production follows predictable patterns, with peak generation occurring during summer months when day length is longest and sun angles are optimal. Winter production decreases due to shorter days and potential snow coverage, but West Virginia's relatively mild winter temperatures compared to northern states help maintain reasonable photovoltaic efficiency throughout the year. Modern solar panels perform well in the state's climate conditions, with crystalline silicon panels being the most popular choice due to their proven performance in varied weather conditions.</p>

<h2>West Virginia Incentives & Rebates</h2>

<p>West Virginia residents have access to several important financial incentives for solar panel and HVAC system installations, with the federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) serving as the primary driver for solar adoption. This federal incentive allows homeowners to deduct 30% of the total solar installation cost from their federal taxes, with no cap on the credit amount. The 30% rate is available through 2032, after which it steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034 before expiring for residential installations.</p>

<p>The state of West Virginia offers a property tax exemption for solar energy systems, ensuring that the added value of solar panels does not increase property tax assessments. This exemption applies to both residential and commercial solar installations and remains in effect for the life of the system. Additionally, solar equipment purchases are exempt from state sales tax, providing immediate savings during the installation process.</p>

<p>Appalachian Power, the state's primary utility provider, offers net metering for solar customers, allowing excess electricity generated during peak production periods to be fed back into the grid for credit. The utility credits solar customers at the retail rate for excess generation, effectively allowing the electric meter to run backward during high production periods. While Appalachian Power doesn't currently offer direct solar rebates, they do provide energy efficiency rebates for qualifying HVAC equipment, including heat pumps and high-efficiency air conditioners. These rebates typically range from \$300 to \$800 depending on system efficiency ratings and can be combined with federal tax credits for HVAC equipment that meets Energy Star requirements.</p>

<p>The federal government also provides tax credits for qualifying HVAC equipment through various energy efficiency programs. Heat pumps, geothermal systems, and other high-efficiency heating and cooling equipment may qualify for federal tax credits of 10-30% of installation costs, depending on the specific technology and efficiency ratings. These incentives can significantly reduce the upfront costs of system upgrades and improve payback periods for homeowners investing in energy-efficient climate control systems.</p>
