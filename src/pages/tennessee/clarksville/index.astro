const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Clarksville, Tennessee</h2>
<p>Clarksville, Tennessee presents excellent opportunities for homeowners to benefit from solar energy and efficient HVAC systems. With Montgomery County's hot-humid climate featuring long, sweltering summers and mild winters, residents face significant energy costs throughout the year. The current electricity rate of 10.9¢/kWh from Clarksville Department of Electricity (CDE) is slightly above the national average, making solar power an increasingly attractive investment for the city's 166,722 residents.</p>

<p>The combination of abundant sunshine year-round and rising utility costs creates ideal conditions for solar adoption in Clarksville. Homeowners with typical 1,920 square foot homes can see substantial savings by pairing solar panels with high-efficiency HVAC systems designed for Tennessee's demanding climate. The hot-humid conditions require robust cooling systems for comfort, but smart energy choices can dramatically reduce monthly utility bills while improving home comfort and property values.</p>

<p>Solar installation costs in Clarksville typically range from \$2.50 to \$2.90 per watt before incentives. For a typical 1,920 square foot home, a 6-8kW system is usually sufficient to offset most electricity usage. With CDE's net metering program, excess solar production credits back to your account at the retail rate of 10.9¢/kWh, maximizing your investment return. Most Clarksville homeowners see payback periods of 10-12 years, with systems lasting 25-30 years.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Clarksville</h2>
<p>Clarksville's hot-humid climate demands HVAC systems specifically designed for consistent cooling and dehumidification. Summer temperatures regularly exceed 85°F with high humidity levels, placing heavy demands on air conditioning systems from May through September. For optimal performance and efficiency, homeowners should invest in systems with SEER ratings of at least 16, though SEER 18-20 units provide better long-term savings given the extensive cooling season.</p>

<p>Heat pumps are particularly well-suited for Clarksville's climate, providing both efficient cooling and heating for the mild winter months. Variable-speed systems offer superior humidity control and energy efficiency compared to single-stage units. Proper sizing is critical for the 1,920 square foot average home size - typically requiring 2.5 to 3.5 tons of cooling capacity depending on insulation levels, window quality, and home orientation. Pairing a high-efficiency HVAC system with solar panels creates an ideal combination, as peak solar production coincides with maximum cooling demands during summer afternoons.</p>

<h3>Recommended HVAC Features for Clarksville</h3>
<ul>
<li>SEER rating of 16+ (preferably 18-20 for maximum efficiency)</li>
<li>Variable-speed compressor for better humidity control</li>
<li>Heat pump technology for year-round efficiency</li>
<li>Proper ductwork sealing to handle humid conditions</li>
<li>Smart thermostats to optimize solar energy usage</li>
<li>UV lights and enhanced filtration for air quality</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clarksville Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Clarksville homeowners have access to several valuable incentives for solar and HVAC upgrades. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on the total cost of solar installations through 2032, stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the full system cost including equipment, installation, and permitting fees, making it the most significant incentive available to local homeowners.</p>

<p>While Tennessee doesn't offer state-level solar rebates, the Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA) programs may benefit some areas, though CDE customers should verify specific local programs. CDE has historically offered rebates for high-efficiency HVAC systems and energy-efficient appliances, though availability varies by year and budget. Additionally, property tax exemptions for solar installations mean the added home value from solar panels won't increase your property tax burden in Montgomery County.</p>

<h3>Available Incentive Programs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Federal Solar ITC: 30% tax credit through 2032</li>
<li>CDE Energy Efficiency Rebates: Up to \$500 for qualifying HVAC systems</li>
<li>Property tax exemption for solar equipment value</li>
<li>Net metering at full retail rate (10.9¢/kWh)</li>
<li>USDA Rural Development grants for eligible areas</li>
</ul>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Clarksville</h2>
<p>Different neighborhoods in Clarksville present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. Historic downtown areas like the Cunningham area feature older homes that may require electrical upgrades before solar installation, but these properties often have excellent south-facing roof orientations. The mature trees provide natural cooling but can create shading challenges for solar panels.</p>

<p>Newer developments in areas like Sango and Saint Bethlehem Pike typically feature modern electrical systems ideal for solar integration and newer HVAC systems. However, these neighborhoods often have smaller lots with potential shading from neighboring homes. The Rossview area, popular with Fort Campbell families, features a mix of newer construction with good solar potential and adequate space for ground-mount systems when rooftop installations aren't optimal.</p>

<p>Rural areas in northern Montgomery County often have the best solar potential due to minimal shading and larger properties, though the distance from Clarksville proper may affect installation costs slightly. These areas may also have different utility considerations or be eligible for USDA rural development programs that can offset installation costs.</p>
