const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Milwaukee</h2>
<p>Milwaukee's harsh winters and moderate summers create unique HVAC challenges for the city's 577,222 residents. With temperatures regularly dropping below freezing from December through February and summer highs reaching the 80s, homeowners need reliable heating and cooling systems that can handle extreme temperature swings. The cold climate means heating costs dominate energy bills, making efficient furnaces and heat pumps critical investments for Milwaukee County residents.</p>

<p>With We Energies electricity rates at 14.8¢/kWh, Milwaukee homeowners face moderate energy costs compared to national averages. However, the extended heating season means annual energy consumption is typically higher than warmer climates. A properly sized and efficient HVAC system can significantly reduce utility bills, with high-efficiency heat pumps offering potential savings of \$800-1,200 annually compared to older gas furnaces or electric resistance heating systems.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Milwaukee Climate</h2>
<p>For Milwaukee's cold climate, dual-fuel heat pump systems offer the best performance and efficiency. These systems use electric heat pump technology during mild weather and switch to gas backup when temperatures drop below 25°F. Look for heat pumps with SEER ratings of 16+ and HSPF ratings of 9.0 or higher. Cold-climate heat pumps from manufacturers like Mitsubishi, Carrier, and Trane can operate efficiently down to -13°F, making them ideal for Wisconsin winters. For air conditioning needs, 16-18 SEER units provide excellent efficiency without over-investing, since cooling season is relatively short in Milwaukee. Gas furnaces should have AFUE ratings of 90%+ to maximize heating efficiency during the long winter months.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Milwaukee</h2>
<p>Milwaukee residents can access multiple rebate programs to offset HVAC installation costs. The federal Residential Clean Energy Credit offers 30% tax credits (up to \$2,000) for qualifying heat pumps installed through 2032. We Energies provides rebates up to \$1,200 for ENERGY STAR certified heat pumps and \$400-800 for high-efficiency air conditioners. Wisconsin's Focus on Energy program offers additional rebates of \$300-600 for qualifying equipment. Combined with manufacturer rebates often ranging \$200-500, total incentives can reduce system costs by \$2,000-4,000. We Energies also offers 0% financing for up to 60 months on qualifying HVAC upgrades, making energy-efficient systems more affordable for Milwaukee homeowners.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Milwaukee</h2>
<p>Select Milwaukee HVAC contractors with proper Wisconsin licensing and EPA certifications for refrigerant handling. Look for companies with at least 10 years of local experience handling cold-climate installations and emergency service capabilities during harsh winters. Top contractors should offer comprehensive warranties (10+ years on equipment, 2+ years on labor) and provide detailed load calculations to properly size systems for Milwaukee's climate extremes. Check Better Business Bureau ratings, Google reviews, and ask for local references from recent installations. Reputable contractors will offer free estimates, explain rebate programs, and provide detailed written proposals. Emergency service availability is crucial given Milwaukee's severe weather, so choose companies offering 24/7 heating repair during winter months.</p>
