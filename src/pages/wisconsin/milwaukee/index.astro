const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Milwaukee, Wisconsin</h2>
<p>Milwaukee's position as Wisconsin's largest city with 577,222 residents makes it an increasingly attractive market for solar energy and HVAC upgrades. Despite Wisconsin's cold climate, Milwaukee receives substantial sunlight during spring and summer months, generating excellent solar production potential. With We Energies charging 14.8¢/kWh - well above the national average - Milwaukee homeowners can achieve significant savings by investing in solar panels to offset their high electricity costs.</p>

<p>The city's cold climate creates unique opportunities for both solar and HVAC investments. Milwaukee's average home size of 1,680 square feet typically requires robust heating systems that drive up winter energy bills. Modern heat pumps and high-efficiency furnaces paired with solar panels create an ideal combination for year-round energy savings. The contrast between frigid winters and warm summers means Milwaukee residents benefit greatly from smart energy solutions that reduce dependence on We Energies' grid power.</p>

<p>Solar installation costs in Milwaukee typically range from \$3.00 to \$3.50 per watt before incentives. The federal 30% tax credit significantly reduces upfront costs, making solar more accessible for Milwaukee homeowners. With We Energies' net metering program, excess solar production during sunny months helps offset winter electricity usage when solar production decreases. Most Milwaukee homes benefit from 6kW to 8kW systems that can cover 70-90% of annual electricity needs.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Milwaukee</h2>
<p>Milwaukee's cold climate demands robust HVAC solutions designed for temperature extremes. Winter temperatures regularly drop below 20°F, requiring heating systems capable of maintaining comfort while operating efficiently. For Milwaukee homes, high-efficiency gas furnaces with 90+ AFUE ratings paired with central air conditioning systems rated 14-16 SEER provide optimal year-round performance. Heat pumps are becoming increasingly popular, especially cold-climate models that operate effectively down to -5°F.</p>

<p>Given Milwaukee's 1,680 square foot average home size, most properties require 60,000-80,000 BTU heating capacity and 2.5-3 ton cooling systems. Ductless mini-split systems work excellently for home additions or older Milwaukee homes without existing ductwork. Smart thermostats are particularly valuable in Milwaukee's variable climate, automatically adjusting temperatures and reducing energy waste. Proper insulation and air sealing are crucial complements to any HVAC upgrade in Milwaukee's harsh winter environment.</p>

<h2>Milwaukee Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Milwaukee residents have access to multiple energy incentives that significantly reduce solar and HVAC upgrade costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on total solar installation costs through 2032, then stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Wisconsin's renewable energy property tax exemption ensures solar installations don't increase property taxes, providing additional long-term savings.</p>

<p>We Energies offers rebates for energy-efficient HVAC equipment, including up to \$600 for high-efficiency furnaces and \$250-\$400 for qualifying air conditioning units. The utility's Energy Efficiency Rewards program provides additional incentives for smart thermostats, duct sealing, and insulation improvements. Milwaukee's Focus on Energy program offers comprehensive energy audits and rebates for whole-home efficiency upgrades. These combined incentives can reduce total project costs by 35-45% for homeowners investing in both solar and HVAC improvements.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Milwaukee</h2>
<p>Milwaukee's diverse neighborhoods each present unique opportunities for solar and HVAC installations. The East Side and Riverwest feature many historic homes with mature tree canopy, requiring careful solar site assessment but offering excellent retrofit potential for modern HVAC systems. Bay View's mix of newer construction and renovated properties provides ideal conditions for both solar panels and high-efficiency HVAC upgrades.</p>

<p>Walker's Point and the Third Ward showcase Milwaukee's urban renewal with newer construction that often accommodates solar installations easily. These neighborhoods' proximity to downtown makes energy efficiency particularly valuable. Wauwatosa and West Allis suburbs feature larger lots with optimal south-facing roof exposure for solar panels. The North Side's affordable housing stock benefits significantly from solar and HVAC incentive programs, making energy improvements accessible to diverse income levels. Each neighborhood's unique architecture and tree coverage requires customized approaches to maximize solar production and HVAC efficiency.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Milwaukee</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in Milwaukee?</h3><p>Solar panel systems in Milwaukee typically cost \$15,000-\$30,000 before incentives, depending on size. After the 30% federal tax credit, homeowners pay \$10,500-\$21,000. A 6kW system averaging \$18,000 costs \$12,600 after credits and saves approximately \$1,065 annually with We Energies' 14.8¢/kWh rates. Most Milwaukee installations pay for themselves within 10-12 years.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Best HVAC for Milwaukee climate?</h3><p>Milwaukee's cold climate performs best with high-efficiency gas furnaces (90+ AFUE) paired with 14+ SEER air conditioning. Cold-climate heat pumps are increasingly popular, operating efficiently down to -5°F while providing both heating and cooling. Ductless mini-splits work excellently for additions or homes without existing ductwork. Smart thermostats are essential for managing Milwaukee's temperature extremes efficiently.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does We Energies offer solar rebates?</h3><p>We Energies doesn't offer direct solar rebates but provides net metering, crediting customers for excess solar production at retail rates. The utility offers substantial HVAC rebates up to \$600 for high-efficiency furnaces and \$250-\$400 for qualifying air conditioners. Combined with federal tax credits and Wisconsin's property tax exemption, Milwaukee solar customers access significant savings without utility-specific solar incentives.</p></div>

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How does Milwaukee's winter affect solar production?</h3><p>Milwaukee solar panels produce 60-70% less electricity during winter months due to shorter days and snow cover. However, cold temperatures actually increase panel efficiency, and snow typically slides off tilted panels. Annual production remains strong because Wisconsin summers provide 15+ hours of daylight. Net metering with We Energies allows summer overproduction to offset winter usage, balancing seasonal variations effectively.</p></div>
