const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Madison, Wisconsin</h2>
<p>Madison, Wisconsin presents excellent opportunities for homeowners looking to upgrade their energy systems with solar panels and modern HVAC solutions. Despite the cold climate, Madison receives ample sunlight throughout the year, making solar installations highly effective. With MGE's electricity rates at 14.2¢ per kWh, which is slightly above the national average, solar panels can provide substantial long-term savings for the city's 269,840 residents. The combination of rising energy costs and abundant solar resources makes this an ideal time for Madison homeowners to consider renewable energy investments.</p>

<p>The cold Wisconsin climate also creates unique opportunities for HVAC system optimization. Modern heat pumps and high-efficiency furnaces can dramatically reduce heating costs during Madison's harsh winters, while proper cooling systems ensure comfort during humid summers. When paired with solar panels, these energy-efficient HVAC systems can operate at minimal cost, creating a comprehensive home energy solution. MGE's net metering program allows solar customers to sell excess power back to the grid, further enhancing the financial benefits of solar installation in Dane County.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in Madison typically range from \$3.00 to \$3.50 per watt installed, making it competitive with national averages. For Madison's average home size of 1,750 square feet, a 6-8kW system usually provides optimal energy production. These calculations are based on MGE's current rate of 14.2¢ per kWh and assume average solar production of 4.2 peak sun hours daily in the Madison area. Installation costs can vary based on roof complexity, equipment selection, and installer choice, but most Madison homeowners see payback periods of 8-12 years.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Madison</h2>
<p>Madison's cold climate demands robust heating systems capable of handling temperatures that regularly drop below freezing from November through March. For optimal efficiency, homeowners should consider high-efficiency gas furnaces with AFUE ratings of 90% or higher, or modern cold-climate heat pumps designed to operate effectively in sub-zero temperatures. Air conditioning systems should have SEER ratings of at least 16 for optimal summer cooling efficiency, though 18+ SEER units provide better long-term value given Madison's humid summers.</p>

<p>Heat pump technology has advanced significantly, making air-source heat pumps viable even in Madison's harsh winters. Modern cold-climate heat pumps can operate efficiently down to -15°F, providing both heating and cooling with exceptional efficiency. Geothermal heat pumps are also excellent options for Madison homes, taking advantage of stable ground temperatures to provide year-round comfort. When combined with solar panels, these efficient HVAC systems can dramatically reduce or eliminate utility bills, even during peak heating and cooling seasons.</p>

<h2>Madison Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Madison residents have access to multiple incentive programs that make solar and HVAC upgrades more affordable. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit for solar installations through 2032, reducing to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the total system cost, including equipment, installation, and permits. Wisconsin also offers various state-level incentives, including Focus on Energy rebates for high-efficiency HVAC systems and energy audits.</p>

<p>MGE participates in several rebate programs for energy-efficient home improvements. Their Shared Solar program allows customers to purchase solar energy without installing panels on their property, while net metering ensures fair compensation for excess solar production. Additionally, MGE offers rebates for Energy Star certified air conditioners, heat pumps, and smart thermostats. Property tax exemptions for renewable energy systems in Wisconsin mean that adding solar panels won't increase your property tax assessment, providing additional long-term savings.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Madison</h2>
<p>Madison's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. The Isthmus area, including downtown and Near East Side neighborhoods like Williamson-Marquette, features many historic homes that may require specialized installation approaches and careful HVAC system selection to maintain architectural integrity while maximizing efficiency. These older homes often benefit significantly from modern HVAC upgrades due to their age and construction methods.</p>

<p>West Side neighborhoods like Hilldale and Midvale Heights typically feature newer construction with better roof orientations for solar panels and more standardized HVAC system installations. The Far West Side, including areas like Gammon Road and Mineral Point, offers newer homes with optimal roof space for larger solar arrays and modern HVAC infrastructure. East Side neighborhoods such as Atwood and Schenk-Atwood-Starkweather-Yahara provide excellent solar potential with many south-facing roofs, while North Side areas like Northport and Sherman often feature larger lots that accommodate ground-mounted solar systems and geothermal installations.</p>
