const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Green Bay, Wisconsin</h2>
<p>Green Bay, Wisconsin presents an excellent opportunity for homeowners to invest in solar panels and efficient HVAC systems. Despite the cold climate, Green Bay receives substantial sunlight during the summer months, and modern solar technology performs well even in cooler temperatures. With WPS (Wisconsin Public Service) charging residents 14.5¢ per kWh, which is above the national average, solar panels can provide significant long-term savings for the city's 107,395 residents. The combination of federal tax credits, state incentives, and net metering policies through WPS makes solar adoption increasingly attractive for Brown County homeowners.</p>

<p>The cold Wisconsin winters make HVAC efficiency crucial for Green Bay residents, where heating costs can represent 40-50% of annual energy bills. High-efficiency heating systems, particularly those that can integrate with solar power, offer substantial savings opportunities. With average home sizes of 1,820 square feet, Green Bay homeowners can benefit from right-sized HVAC systems that maximize comfort while minimizing energy consumption. The dual investment in solar panels and efficient HVAC systems creates a synergistic effect, reducing both heating costs and overall electricity demand from WPS.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in Green Bay typically range from \$3.00 to \$3.50 per watt installed, which is competitive with national averages. For the average 1,820 square foot home in Green Bay, a 6-8kW system usually provides optimal coverage. The payback period for solar installations in Green Bay averages 10-13 years, depending on energy usage patterns and system size. WPS's net metering program allows homeowners to receive credit for excess energy produced, though the buyback rate is lower than the retail rate. Winter snow can temporarily reduce solar production, but panels are designed to shed snow naturally, and the reflective properties of snow can actually boost performance on clear winter days.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Green Bay</h2>
<p>Green Bay's cold climate demands robust heating systems capable of maintaining comfort during harsh Wisconsin winters where temperatures can drop well below zero. For this climate zone, high-efficiency gas furnaces with AFUE ratings of 90% or higher are typically recommended, paired with central air conditioning units rated at minimum 16 SEER for cooling efficiency. Heat pumps can be effective in Green Bay when choosing cold-climate models specifically designed for sub-zero operation, with backup heating for extreme cold snaps. Given the 1,820 square foot average home size, most residents need 60,000-80,000 BTU heating capacity and 2.5-3 ton cooling systems.</p>

<p>Smart thermostats and zoning systems work particularly well in Green Bay homes, allowing residents to optimize heating schedules around the area's variable winter conditions. Geothermal heat pumps represent an excellent long-term investment for Green Bay homeowners, as ground temperatures remain stable year-round, providing efficient heating even during the coldest months. When combined with solar panels, electric heating systems become more viable, as homeowners can offset heating costs with solar production during shoulder seasons. Proper insulation and air sealing are crucial in Green Bay's climate, often providing better returns on investment than upgrading HVAC equipment alone.</p>

<h2>Green Bay Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Green Bay residents have access to multiple incentives that significantly reduce the cost of solar and HVAC upgrades. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on solar installations through 2032, then stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Wisconsin offers additional state incentives, including property tax exemptions for solar installations, meaning the added home value from solar panels won't increase property taxes. The state's net metering law requires utilities like WPS to provide credit for excess solar production, though rates vary by utility and time of year.</p>

<p>WPS offers various rebate programs for energy-efficient HVAC equipment, including rebates up to \$600 for high-efficiency furnaces and \$300 for qualifying air conditioning units. The utility also provides rebates for smart thermostats and other energy-saving devices. Focus on Energy, Wisconsin's statewide energy efficiency program, offers additional cash back incentives for HVAC upgrades and energy audits. Brown County and Green Bay occasionally offer local incentive programs for renewable energy installations. Homeowners should also consider federal tax credits for high-efficiency HVAC equipment, which can provide additional savings of \$300-\$600 depending on the equipment installed.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Green Bay</h2>
<p>Green Bay's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. The historic Astor neighborhood, with its tree-lined streets and older homes, often requires careful solar panel placement to work around mature trees, while older homes may need electrical upgrades to support modern solar systems. These historic homes typically benefit most from high-efficiency HVAC retrofits due to their age and construction methods. The Allouez area, known for larger, newer homes, typically has ideal roof orientations for solar and modern electrical systems that easily accommodate solar installations.</p>

<p>East Green Bay neighborhoods like Bellevue offer excellent solar potential with newer construction and fewer shading issues, while the suburban layout allows for optimal HVAC system sizing for the area's larger homes. West side neighborhoods near Lambeau Field feature a mix of home sizes and ages, with many ranch-style homes perfectly suited for solar installations. The De Pere area, technically separate but closely connected to Green Bay, offers some of the best solar potential in the region due to newer construction and optimal roof orientations. Waterfront areas along Green Bay may face additional permitting considerations but often have excellent solar exposure due to reduced tree coverage near the water.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Green Bay</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in Green Bay?</h3><p>Solar panel installations in Green Bay typically cost \$3.00-\$3.50 per watt, meaning a 6kW system costs \$18,000-\$21,000 before the federal tax credit. After the 30% federal credit, homeowners pay \$12,600-\$14,700. With WPS rates at 14.5¢/kWh, a 6kW system saves approximately \$960-\$1,140 annually, providing payback in 11-13 years.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Best HVAC for Green Bay climate?</h3><p>For Green Bay's cold climate, high-efficiency gas furnaces with 90%+ AFUE ratings paired with 16+ SEER air conditioning work best for most homes. Cold-climate heat pumps are increasingly popular, especially when paired with solar panels. Geothermal systems offer the highest efficiency but require larger upfront investment. For 1,820 sq ft homes, expect to need 60,000-80,000 BTU heating capacity.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does WPS offer solar rebates?</h3><p>WPS doesn't currently offer direct solar rebates, but they do provide net metering, allowing customers to receive credit for excess solar production. WPS does offer rebates for energy-efficient HVAC equipment up to \$600 for furnaces and \$300 for AC units. The federal 30% tax credit and Wisconsin's property tax exemption for solar provide the primary financial incentives for solar installations in Green Bay.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How does snow affect solar panels in Green Bay?</h3><p>Snow can temporarily reduce solar production, but panels are designed to shed snow naturally due to their smooth surface and mounting angle. The dark color helps snow melt quickly, and snow reflection can actually boost performance on sunny winter days. Most Green Bay solar systems produce 10-15% less annually due to snow coverage, but this is factored into system design and financial projections.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">What size solar system do I need in Green Bay?</h3><p>For Green Bay's average 1,820 sq ft homes, a 6-8kW solar system typically provides optimal coverage. This size system generates 7,000-10,000 kWh annually, covering most of a typical home's electricity needs. Homes with electric heating or large families may need 10kW+ systems. A professional energy audit can determine the ideal system size based on your specific usage patterns and WPS billing history.</p></div>
