const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Wisconsin presents an excellent opportunity for both solar panel installations and energy-efficient HVAC systems, despite common misconceptions about the state's solar potential. With an average of 4.1 peak sun hours per day, Wisconsin receives more solar radiation than Germany, which leads the world in solar adoption. The state's electricity rates averaging 14.3¢ per kilowatt-hour create compelling economics for solar investments, while the continental climate with cold winters and warm summers makes high-efficiency HVAC systems essential for year-round comfort and energy savings.</p>

<p>We Energies, the primary utility provider serving much of Wisconsin, offers net metering programs that allow solar panel owners to sell excess electricity back to the grid, further improving the financial returns of solar installations. Combined with federal tax incentives and Wisconsin's property tax exemption for renewable energy systems, homeowners can achieve significant long-term savings while reducing their carbon footprint.</p>

<p>The state's diverse climate zones, ranging from USDA Zone 3 in the north to Zone 5 in the south, require carefully planned HVAC solutions that can handle temperature swings from -20°F in winter to 85°F in summer. Modern heat pump technology and high-efficiency furnaces paired with smart thermostats can dramatically reduce energy consumption, making Wisconsin homes more comfortable and cost-effective to operate throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in Wisconsin</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Wisconsin's solar resource is stronger than many residents realize, with the state receiving between 3.8 to 4.4 peak sun hours daily depending on location. Southern Wisconsin cities like Madison and Milwaukee enjoy the highest solar potential, while northern regions still maintain viable solar production levels. The state's cold, clear winter days actually benefit solar panel efficiency, as photovoltaic cells perform better in cooler temperatures. Snow coverage is typically minimal due to panels' dark surfaces and angled installation, allowing for consistent year-round energy production.</p>

<p>A typical 6kW solar system in Wisconsin generates approximately 7,200-8,400 kWh annually, enough to offset 60-80% of an average household's electricity consumption. Peak production occurs during the long summer days of June and July, when systems can generate 150% of monthly household needs, with excess energy credited through net metering. Even during Wisconsin's shorter winter days, solar systems continue producing valuable electricity, with December and January typically yielding 30-40% of peak summer output.</p>

<h3>Smart Thermostats and Controls</h3>
<p>Smart thermostats are particularly valuable in Wisconsin's variable climate, offering programmable schedules that account for the state's dramatic daily and seasonal temperature swings. Models like the Nest Learning Thermostat and Ecobee SmartThermostat can reduce heating and cooling costs by 10-15% through optimized scheduling and learning user preferences. These systems can pre-condition homes before occupants arrive while avoiding energy waste during away periods.</p>

<p>Advanced features like outdoor temperature compensation and humidity control are especially beneficial in Wisconsin. Smart thermostats can integrate with solar panel systems to optimize energy usage during peak production hours, using solar electricity to pre-heat or pre-cool homes before relying on grid power during evening peak rate periods.</p>

<h2>Wisconsin Incentives & Rebates</h2>

<p>Wisconsin homeowners have access to several valuable incentive programs for solar panels and efficient HVAC systems. The federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit for solar panel installations through 2032, then stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the full system cost including equipment, installation, and electrical upgrades, making it one of the most significant incentives available.</p>

<p>Wisconsin offers a property tax exemption for renewable energy systems, meaning the added value from solar panels won't increase property taxes. This exemption can save homeowners hundreds of dollars annually over the system's lifetime. The state also exempts solar equipment from sales tax, providing additional upfront savings of 5-6% on system costs.</p>

<p>We Energies and other Wisconsin utilities offer various rebate programs for energy-efficient HVAC equipment. Rebates typically range from \$300-800 for high-efficiency furnaces, \$200-600 for air source heat pumps, and up to \$1,200 for geothermal systems. Smart thermostats often qualify for \$50-100 rebates when installed with qualifying HVAC equipment. Some utilities also offer time-of-use rates that can benefit solar panel owners by providing higher credit rates during peak demand periods.</p>

<p>Focus on Energy, Wisconsin's statewide energy efficiency program, provides additional rebates and financing options for comprehensive home energy improvements. The program offers cash back for ENERGY STAR certified equipment and can provide low-interest loans for larger efficiency projects combining multiple improvements.</p>

<h2>Combining Solar and HVAC Systems</h2>

<p>Integrating solar panels with efficient HVAC systems creates synergistic benefits for Wisconsin homeowners. Solar production peaks during summer months when air conditioning loads are highest, allowing homes to run cooling systems with minimal grid electricity consumption. Winter heating loads occur during shorter solar production days, but efficient heat pumps can still utilize available solar electricity more effectively than resistance heating.</p>

<p>Battery storage systems are becoming increasingly viable for Wisconsin homes, allowing storage of excess solar production for use during evening heating or cooling periods. Tesla Powerwall, Enphase Encharge, and other residential battery systems can provide backup power during Wisconsin's occasional severe weather events while optimizing solar energy usage throughout the year.</p>

<p>Smart home energy management systems can coordinate solar production with HVAC operation, pre-conditioning homes during peak solar hours and reducing grid dependence during expensive peak rate periods. This integration can increase overall energy savings by 15-25% compared to installing solar or HVAC improvements independently.</p>
