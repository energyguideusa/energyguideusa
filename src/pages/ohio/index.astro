const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Ohio presents an excellent opportunity for homeowners looking to invest in solar panels and efficient HVAC systems. With an average of 4.0 sun hours per day, the Buckeye State receives sufficient solar irradiation to make solar installations highly viable and cost-effective. The state's solar potential, combined with relatively high electricity rates averaging 12.6¢ per kWh, creates substantial opportunities for energy savings through solar adoption. AEP Ohio, serving as the primary utility provider across much of the state, offers net metering programs that allow solar customers to sell excess energy back to the grid, further enhancing the financial benefits of solar installations.</p>

<p>Ohio's continental climate, characterized by hot, humid summers and cold winters, places significant demands on heating and cooling systems throughout the year. This climate pattern makes efficient HVAC systems essential for maintaining comfortable indoor environments while controlling energy costs. Modern high-efficiency heat pumps, central air conditioning systems, and smart thermostats can dramatically reduce energy consumption compared to older systems. When combined with solar panels, homeowners can achieve near energy independence while significantly reducing their carbon footprint and monthly utility bills.</p>

<p>The convergence of favorable solar conditions, supportive state policies, and substantial heating and cooling needs makes Ohio an ideal market for integrated solar and HVAC solutions. Property tax exemptions for solar installations, federal tax credits, and utility incentive programs create multiple layers of financial benefits that can reduce the payback period for these investments to as little as 6-8 years, while providing decades of ongoing savings.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in Ohio</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Ohio's solar resource potential is stronger than many residents realize, with the state receiving approximately 4.0 peak sun hours per day on average. This solar irradiation level places Ohio in a favorable position for solar energy production, comparable to states like New York and Pennsylvania that have seen significant solar adoption. The state's relatively flat terrain and moderate cloud cover patterns provide consistent solar exposure throughout most regions, with southern Ohio counties like Hamilton, Clermont, and Brown receiving slightly higher irradiation levels than northern counties near Lake Erie.</p>

<p>A typical residential solar installation in Ohio can be expected to produce between 1,100 and 1,300 kWh per installed kW per year, depending on system orientation, tilt angle, and local weather patterns. For a standard 6kW residential system, this translates to approximately 7,200-7,800 kWh of annual production, which covers 60-80% of an average Ohio household's electricity consumption. Systems facing south with optimal tilt angles of 35-40 degrees will achieve the highest production levels, though east and west-facing installations can still provide substantial energy generation and savings.</p>

<p>Seasonal production patterns in Ohio show peak generation during late spring and early summer months, with May through August typically producing the highest monthly outputs. Winter production, while lower due to shorter days and occasional snow coverage, still contributes meaningfully to annual energy production. Modern solar panels perform efficiently even in cold temperatures, and Ohio's crisp winter days often provide excellent solar generation when snow coverage is minimal.</p>

<p>HVAC system costs in Ohio vary significantly based on home size, existing infrastructure, and chosen technology. The installation costs above assume replacement of existing systems in homes with established ductwork, though new construction or major renovations may require additional ductwork installation, adding \$3,000-7,000 to project costs. Geothermal systems, while requiring higher upfront investment, provide the greatest long-term savings and can qualify for additional federal tax credits, making them increasingly attractive for homeowners planning long-term residence.</p>

<h2>Ohio Incentives & Rebates</h2>

<p>Ohio homeowners have access to several valuable incentives that significantly reduce the cost of solar panel and HVAC system installations. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) allows homeowners to deduct 30% of their solar installation costs from their federal taxes, with no cap on the credit amount. This incentive applies to the total system cost including panels, inverters, mounting equipment, and installation labor. For a typical \$18,000 solar installation, the federal credit provides \$5,400 in tax savings, substantially reducing the net cost and improving the investment return.</p>

<p>Ohio provides additional support through its property tax exemption for solar energy systems. Under Ohio Revised Code Section 5715.01, the added value from solar panel installations is exempt from property tax assessments, ensuring homeowners won't face increased property taxes despite the substantial value addition to their homes. This exemption applies to both the equipment and installation costs and remains in effect for the life of the system. Given Ohio's average property tax rate of approximately 1.6%, this exemption can save homeowners hundreds of dollars annually on a typical solar installation.</p>

<p>AEP Ohio offers several programs supporting energy efficiency and renewable energy adoption. Their net metering program allows solar customers to receive retail rate credits for excess energy fed back into the grid, maximizing the value of solar production. The utility also provides rebates for high-efficiency HVAC equipment, smart thermostats, and energy audits. Their Home Energy Audit program offers comprehensive assessments for \$50, identifying opportunities for energy savings and potential rebates. Additionally, AEP Ohio's Peak Time Rewards program provides bill credits for reducing energy usage during peak demand periods, which pairs excellently with solar+storage systems that can shift energy usage patterns.</p>

<p>Local incentive programs vary by municipality, with cities like Columbus, Cincinnati, and Cleveland offering additional rebates or streamlined permitting for renewable energy installations. Some Ohio counties participate in Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing programs, allowing homeowners to finance solar and energy efficiency improvements through their property tax bills with repayment periods up to 20 years. These programs make solar and HVAC upgrades accessible to homeowners who might not have available cash or traditional financing options.</p>
