const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Columbus</h2>
<p>Columbus, Ohio's cold-mixed climate presents unique challenges for homeowners seeking efficient HVAC solutions. With over 905,000 residents in Franklin County experiencing temperature swings from below freezing winters to humid summers reaching the 80s and 90s, HVAC systems must handle both substantial heating and cooling loads throughout the year. The city's continental climate means residents typically use heating systems for 5-6 months annually and air conditioning for 3-4 months, making year-round efficiency crucial for managing energy costs.</p>

<p>With AEP Ohio's electricity rate of 12.8¢/kWh, Columbus homeowners pay slightly above the national average for electricity, making energy-efficient HVAC systems a smart investment. The dual seasonal demands mean that heat pumps often provide excellent value, as they can efficiently heat and cool homes. However, during Columbus's coldest winter days when temperatures drop below 25°F, backup heating systems become essential. This climate pattern makes proper system sizing and efficiency ratings critical factors in controlling the typical Columbus household's annual HVAC costs of \$1,200-\$1,800.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Columbus Climate</h2>
<p>For Columbus's cold-mixed climate, dual-fuel heat pump systems with gas furnace backup represent the optimal solution for most homes. These systems should feature minimum 16 SEER cooling efficiency and 8.5 HSPF heating efficiency to handle the city's diverse weather patterns cost-effectively. During mild fall and spring weather (45-65°F), heat pumps operate at peak efficiency, while the gas backup engages during Columbus's typical winter lows of 15-25°F. For cooling-focused needs, 16-18 SEER air conditioners paired with 90%+ AFUE gas furnaces provide excellent performance. Variable-speed systems excel in Columbus due to the frequent temperature fluctuations, offering better humidity control during summer months and more consistent heating during the extended winter season. Proper sizing is critical - Columbus homes typically require 2.5-4 tons of cooling capacity and 80,000-120,000 BTU heating capacity depending on square footage, insulation, and home age.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Columbus</h2>
<p>Columbus residents can access substantial HVAC rebates through multiple programs. Federal tax credits offer 30% of installation costs up to \$2,000 for heat pumps and \$600-\$2,000 for high-efficiency air conditioners through 2032. AEP Ohio provides rebates up to \$400 for ENERGY STAR certified air conditioners and up to \$800 for qualifying heat pump systems. The utility also offers smart thermostat rebates of \$50-\$100 and ductwork improvement incentives up to \$350. Ohio's Home Energy Loan Program provides low-interest financing for HVAC upgrades, while the state's tax credit program offers additional savings for geothermal systems. Local programs through the City of Columbus occasionally provide weatherization assistance that includes HVAC improvements for qualifying residents. Combined, these incentives can reduce total HVAC installation costs by \$1,500-\$4,000, significantly improving payback periods for high-efficiency systems.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Columbus</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in Columbus requires verifying Ohio licensing, insurance, and Better Business Bureau ratings. Look for contractors with extensive experience in cold-mixed climates who understand proper sizing calculations for Columbus's weather patterns. Top contractors offer comprehensive warranties - typically 10 years on equipment and 2-5 years on labor - and provide 24/7 emergency service crucial during Columbus's temperature extremes. Request detailed load calculations using Manual J procedures, ensuring systems aren't oversized for the climate. Reputable Columbus contractors should be familiar with AEP Ohio rebate programs and assist with paperwork submission. Check references from recent Columbus installations, verify worker compensation insurance, and ensure they pull proper permits through Franklin County. Quality contractors provide detailed written estimates, explain equipment options specific to local climate needs, and offer maintenance plans to protect your investment through Columbus's demanding seasonal cycles.</p>
