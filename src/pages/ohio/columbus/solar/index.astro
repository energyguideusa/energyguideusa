const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Columbus</h2>
<p>Columbus, Ohio's Cold-Mixed climate presents unique opportunities for solar energy adoption. Despite experiencing cold winters and variable weather patterns, Columbus receives approximately 4.2 peak sun hours daily on average, making solar panels a viable investment for the city's 905,748 residents. The combination of AEP Ohio's electricity rate of 12.8¢/kWh and abundant federal and state incentives creates favorable conditions for homeowners considering solar installation.</p>

<p>The Cold-Mixed climate in Franklin County means solar systems must be designed to withstand temperature fluctuations, snow loads, and occasional severe weather. Modern solar panels actually perform more efficiently in cooler temperatures, making Columbus's climate advantageous during spring, fall, and winter months. With AEP Ohio serving as the primary utility provider, residents can take advantage of net metering programs that credit excess solar production back to the grid, maximizing the value of their investment throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Columbus</h2>
<p>Columbus residents can access substantial solar incentives that significantly reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit on the total system cost through 2032, then decreases to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Ohio offers additional state-level support through the Ohio Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) program, which allows system owners to earn credits for the clean energy they produce. These SRECs can be sold to utilities, providing ongoing income that improves the overall return on investment. AEP Ohio participates in net metering, crediting customers at retail rates for excess electricity fed back into the grid, though policies may vary and should be confirmed during the planning process. Local property tax exemptions in Franklin County ensure that the added home value from solar installation doesn't increase property taxes, preserving long-term savings.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Columbus</h2>
<p>Selecting a quality solar installer in Columbus requires careful evaluation of several key factors. Look for companies with proper Ohio licensing, including electrical contractor licenses and solar-specific certifications from organizations like the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP). Experience in Columbus's specific climate conditions is crucial, as installers should understand local building codes, snow load requirements, and optimal panel positioning for Ohio's latitude. Request multiple quotes and compare warranty offerings – reputable companies provide 20-25 year production warranties, 10-15 year equipment warranties, and workmanship guarantees. Check Better Business Bureau ratings, Google reviews, and ask for local references from recent installations. Established Columbus solar companies should also assist with permit acquisition, utility interconnection processes with AEP Ohio, and provide ongoing monitoring and maintenance services to ensure optimal system performance throughout Ohio's varying seasonal conditions.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Columbus</h2>
<p>The return on investment for solar panels in Columbus is compelling when considering the city's 12.8¢/kWh electricity rates and available incentives. A typical 6kW residential system costing \$18,000 before incentives drops to \$12,600 after the federal tax credit, generating approximately \$922 annually in electricity savings. This results in a payback period of 13.7 years, which is competitive for the Midwest region. Over a 25-year system lifespan, Columbus homeowners can expect total savings of \$23,050, representing an 83% return on their initial investment. The financial benefits extend beyond direct electricity savings, as solar installations typically increase home values by 3-4%, adding approximately \$12,000-15,000 to property value for an average system. With AEP Ohio's net metering program, excess production during peak summer months can offset winter consumption, maximizing annual savings. Additionally, electricity rates historically increase 2-3% annually, meaning solar savings will likely grow over time while the system's fixed costs remain constant.</p>
