const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Augusta</h2>
<p>Augusta, Georgia's hot-humid climate provides excellent conditions for solar energy generation, with approximately 4.8 peak sun hours daily throughout the year. With Georgia Power charging residents 12.1¢ per kilowatt-hour, homeowners in Richmond County are paying above the national average for electricity, making solar panels an increasingly attractive investment. The combination of abundant sunshine and higher electricity rates creates favorable conditions for solar adoption among Augusta's 202,081 residents.</p>

<p>Installing solar panels in Augusta requires careful consideration of the humid subtropical climate, which can affect equipment longevity and performance. Professional installers familiar with Georgia's weather patterns will recommend panels and mounting systems designed to withstand high humidity, occasional severe storms, and temperature fluctuations. Georgia Power's net metering program allows Augusta homeowners to sell excess solar energy back to the grid, though the compensation rate is lower than the retail rate, making battery storage an increasingly popular addition to solar installations.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Augusta</h2>
<p>Augusta homeowners can take advantage of the federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which provides a 30% tax credit on the total cost of solar panel installation through 2032, then decreases to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Georgia offers additional state-level incentives, including sales tax exemption on solar equipment purchases and property tax exemption for the added home value from solar installations. While Georgia Power doesn't currently offer cash rebates for residential solar, they do provide net metering, allowing customers to receive credit for excess energy produced. Some Augusta residents may also qualify for USDA Rural Development grants if their property is located in eligible rural areas of Richmond County, potentially providing additional funding for solar installations.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Augusta</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in Augusta, prioritize companies with proper Georgia licensing, including electrical contractor licenses and solar-specific certifications from organizations like NABCEP (North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners). Look for installers with at least five years of experience in Georgia's climate conditions and a portfolio of local installations. Essential factors include comprehensive warranties covering equipment (typically 20-25 years for panels, 10-15 years for inverters) and workmanship (minimum 10 years), positive Better Business Bureau ratings, and detailed proposals that include system design, energy production estimates, and financing options. Reputable Augusta solar companies should also handle all permitting with Richmond County and interconnection agreements with Georgia Power, ensuring compliance with local building codes and utility requirements.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Augusta</h2>
<p>Based on Augusta's 12.1¢/kWh electricity rates and Georgia's solar irradiance levels, homeowners can expect a payback period of approximately 12-13 years for their solar investment. A typical 6kW system producing 8,500 kWh annually would save Augusta residents about \$1,050 per year in electricity costs. Over the 25-year lifespan of solar panels, total savings would reach approximately \$26,250, representing a strong return on the net investment of \$13,020 after federal tax credits. With electricity rates likely to increase over time while solar production remains consistent, actual savings may exceed these conservative estimates. Additionally, solar installations typically increase home values by 3-4%, adding roughly \$10,000-15,000 to property values for average-sized systems in Augusta's real estate market.</p>
