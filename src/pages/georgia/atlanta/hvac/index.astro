const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Atlanta</h2>
<p>Atlanta's hot-humid climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, with the city experiencing average summer temperatures reaching 89°F and humidity levels often exceeding 70%. This combination creates a demanding environment where air conditioning systems must work harder to remove both heat and moisture from indoor air. With Georgia Power's current electricity rate at 12.3¢/kWh, Atlanta homeowners face significant cooling costs during the extended summer season that typically runs from May through September, making energy-efficient HVAC systems a crucial investment for the city's 498,715 residents.</p>

<p>The hot-humid climate in Fulton County requires HVAC systems that excel at dehumidification while maintaining consistent cooling performance. Unlike dry climates where evaporative cooling can be effective, Atlanta's high humidity levels demand refrigerant-based systems with robust moisture removal capabilities. Modern high-efficiency heat pumps and air conditioning units with variable-speed compressors are particularly well-suited for Atlanta's climate, as they can modulate their output to match the varying cooling demands while maintaining optimal humidity control throughout the long cooling season.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Atlanta Climate</h2>
<p>For Atlanta's hot-humid climate, the optimal HVAC system should have a minimum SEER rating of 16, though 18-20 SEER units provide the best long-term value given the extended cooling season and current electricity rates. Heat pumps are particularly well-suited for Atlanta because they provide efficient cooling in summer while offering cost-effective heating during the mild winter months when temperatures rarely drop below freezing. Variable-speed heat pumps with enhanced dehumidification capabilities are ideal, as they can remove up to 40% more humidity than single-speed units while using 30% less energy. Given that Atlanta typically requires cooling for approximately 2,800 hours annually compared to just 1,200 hours of heating, investing in a high-efficiency cooling system with excellent humidity control should be the primary focus for homeowners in Fulton County.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Atlanta</h2>
<p>Atlanta residents can take advantage of several rebate programs to offset HVAC installation costs. The federal tax credit allows homeowners to claim 30% of the cost of qualifying heat pumps and central air systems through 2032, with no maximum limit for heat pumps and up to \$2,000 for central air conditioners. Georgia Power offers rebates up to \$1,200 for ENERGY STAR certified heat pumps and up to \$600 for high-efficiency central air conditioning units installed by participating contractors. Additionally, the state of Georgia provides income tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements, including up to \$2,500 for qualifying HVAC systems. Low-income households may also qualify for weatherization assistance programs that can provide free or heavily subsidized HVAC upgrades through the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Atlanta</h2>
<p>When selecting an HVAC contractor in Atlanta, verify that they hold proper Georgia state licensing and are EPA Section 608 certified for refrigerant handling. Look for contractors with extensive experience in hot-humid climate installations and those who are factory-authorized dealers for major equipment brands, as this often indicates higher training standards and better warranty coverage. Quality contractors should perform Manual J load calculations to properly size equipment for your home's specific needs, which is crucial in Atlanta's climate where oversized units can lead to humidity problems. Ensure the contractor offers comprehensive warranties covering both labor and equipment, provides 24/7 emergency service during peak summer months, and maintains membership in professional organizations like the Air Conditioning Contractors of America (ACCA). Always obtain multiple quotes and verify references from recent customers, particularly those with similar homes and cooling requirements in the Atlanta metro area.</p>
