const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Atlanta, Georgia</h2>
<p>Atlanta, Georgia, with its population of 498,715 residents in Fulton County, presents an excellent opportunity for homeowners to invest in solar panels and efficient HVAC systems. The city's hot-humid climate provides abundant sunshine for solar energy generation, with an average of 218 sunny days per year. With Georgia Power's electricity rates at 12.3¢ per kWh, Atlanta residents pay above the national average, making solar panels an increasingly attractive investment for reducing monthly utility bills and achieving long-term energy independence.</p>

<p>The hot-humid climate in Atlanta creates unique challenges and opportunities for both solar and HVAC systems. Summer temperatures regularly reach the high 80s and 90s with significant humidity, placing substantial demands on cooling systems in the typical 2,080 square foot Atlanta home. This high energy demand for air conditioning, combined with Georgia Power's relatively high electricity rates, means that solar panels can provide substantial savings during peak cooling months. Additionally, modern high-efficiency HVAC systems can work synergistically with solar installations to maximize energy savings and indoor comfort throughout Atlanta's long, humid summers.</p>

<p>Solar panel installations in Atlanta typically cost between \$2.80 to \$3.20 per watt before incentives, with most homeowners choosing systems between 6kW and 10kW to meet their energy needs. The average 2,080 square foot home in Atlanta consumes approximately 1,200 kWh monthly, making an 8kW system ideal for most households. With Georgia Power's net metering program, excess solar energy can be credited back to your account, though at a lower rate than retail electricity prices. Installation costs vary based on roof complexity, panel quality, and local permitting requirements specific to Fulton County.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Atlanta</h2>
<p>Atlanta's hot-humid climate demands HVAC systems specifically designed to handle both high temperatures and moisture control. The most effective systems for Atlanta homes are high-efficiency central air conditioning units with SEER ratings of 16 or higher, paired with variable-speed air handlers that provide superior humidity control. Heat pumps are particularly well-suited for Atlanta's moderate winters and hot summers, offering year-round efficiency with SEER ratings up to 22 and HSPF ratings of 10 or higher for heating performance.</p>

<p>Proper sizing is crucial for Atlanta HVAC systems, as oversized units will short-cycle and fail to adequately remove humidity, while undersized systems will struggle during peak summer months. Most 2,080 square foot Atlanta homes require 3 to 4-ton systems, depending on insulation levels, window efficiency, and home orientation. Ductless mini-split systems are increasingly popular for Atlanta homes, offering zoned comfort control and SEER ratings up to 25. These systems work exceptionally well with solar installations, as their variable-speed compressors can adjust power consumption based on available solar energy production throughout the day.</p>

<h2>Atlanta Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Atlanta residents have access to several valuable incentives that significantly reduce the cost of solar and HVAC installations. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on the total cost of solar panel systems installed through 2032, then decreasing to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the entire system cost, including equipment, installation, and permitting fees, making it one of the most valuable solar incentives available to Atlanta homeowners.</p>

<p>Georgia offers additional state-level incentives, including sales tax exemptions on solar equipment purchases and property tax exemptions that prevent solar installations from increasing property tax assessments. Georgia Power participates in the federal net metering requirements, though their Advanced Solar Initiative program has limited capacity. For HVAC systems, Georgia residents can claim federal tax credits up to \$2,000 for qualifying high-efficiency heat pumps and air conditioning systems that meet ENERGY STAR criteria. Local utility rebates through Georgia Power may also be available for qualifying HVAC upgrades, particularly for systems that help reduce peak demand during summer months.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Atlanta</h2>
<p>Atlanta's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. Buckhead, with its mix of high-end single-family homes and luxury condominiums, offers excellent solar potential due to larger roof spaces and fewer shading concerns from tall trees. The historic Virginia-Highland and Inman Park neighborhoods feature older homes that may require HVAC system upgrades to handle modern cooling demands while preserving architectural integrity. These areas often benefit from ductless mini-split systems that provide efficient cooling without extensive ductwork modifications.</p>

<p>Midtown Atlanta's high-rise buildings and dense urban environment create unique challenges for residential solar installations, though rooftop access is often excellent for those in penthouse units or townhomes. The Grant Park and East Atlanta neighborhoods, with their craftsman-style homes and growing young professional population, have seen significant adoption of both solar and high-efficiency HVAC systems. Decatur, technically separate but closely connected to Atlanta, offers substantial solar potential with its tree-lined streets requiring careful panel placement to avoid shading issues. Each neighborhood must also consider Fulton County's specific permitting requirements and any historic district restrictions that may affect installation options.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Atlanta</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in Atlanta?</h3><p>Solar panel installations in Atlanta typically cost between \$15,000 and \$30,000 before incentives, depending on system size and complexity. After the 30% federal tax credit, most homeowners pay between \$10,500 and \$21,000 for complete systems. The average 8kW system costs approximately \$24,000 before credits, resulting in a final cost of \$16,800 and annual savings of over \$1,180 based on Georgia Power's 12.3¢ per kWh rate.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Best HVAC for Atlanta climate?</h3><p>Heat pumps with SEER ratings of 18 or higher perform exceptionally well in Atlanta's hot-humid climate, providing efficient cooling in summer and adequate heating during mild winters. Variable-speed systems with enhanced humidity control are essential for comfort during Atlanta's humid months. Ductless mini-split systems offer excellent efficiency and zoned comfort control, while traditional central systems work well when properly sized for the typical 2,080 square foot Atlanta home.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does Georgia Power offer solar rebates?</h3><p>Georgia Power's direct solar rebates are currently limited, though they participate in net metering programs that credit excess solar production back to customers at avoided cost rates. The primary financial incentives for Atlanta solar installations come from the 30% federal tax credit and Georgia's sales and property tax exemptions for solar equipment. Georgia Power does offer rebates for energy-efficient HVAC systems and smart thermostats that can complement solar installations.</p></div>

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How long do solar panels last in Atlanta's climate?</h3><p>High-quality solar panels typically last 25-30 years in Atlanta's climate, with most manufacturers offering 20-25 year production warranties. Atlanta's hot summers and occasional severe weather require panels rated for high wind speeds and thermal cycling. Regular maintenance, including annual cleaning and inspection, helps maximize lifespan and performance in Atlanta's humid environment with seasonal pollen and storm debris.</p></div>

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Can I run my HVAC system entirely on solar power?</h3><p>Yes, a properly sized solar system can power your HVAC system and entire home in Atlanta. Most homes require 8-10kW solar systems to offset complete energy usage, including air conditioning during peak summer months. Battery storage systems can provide backup power for critical HVAC operation during outages, though Georgia Power's relatively reliable grid makes batteries optional for most Atlanta homeowners. Peak cooling demands typically align well with peak solar production during sunny summer afternoons.</p></div>
