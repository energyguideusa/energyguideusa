const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Columbus</h2>
<p>Columbus, Georgia's hot-humid climate presents unique challenges for homeowners and their HVAC systems. With a population of 206,922 residents in Muscogee County, the demand for efficient cooling and dehumidification is paramount during the long, sweltering summers that can see temperatures soar into the 90s with humidity levels often exceeding 80%. The hot-humid climate means HVAC systems must work harder and longer to maintain comfortable indoor conditions, making energy efficiency a critical factor for residents looking to manage their utility costs with Georgia Power.</p>

<p>At 11.9¢ per kilowatt-hour, Columbus residents pay slightly below the national average for electricity, but the extended cooling season means annual energy bills can still be substantial. A typical 2,000 square foot home in Columbus can expect to spend \$1,800 to \$2,400 annually on cooling costs alone. The combination of high temperatures and humidity requires HVAC systems that excel at both temperature control and moisture removal, making proper system selection and sizing crucial for comfort and cost control in this Georgia city.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Columbus Climate</h2>
<p>For Columbus's hot-humid climate, homeowners should prioritize systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher and enhanced dehumidification capabilities. Two-stage or variable-speed air conditioners are particularly effective in this climate because they can run longer at lower speeds, providing better humidity control while maintaining consistent temperatures. Heat pumps are excellent choices for Columbus, as the mild winters (average low of 38°F in January) make them highly efficient year-round. Look for systems with humidity control features and consider pairing your HVAC system with a whole-house dehumidifier. Since cooling represents approximately 75% of annual HVAC usage in Columbus compared to just 25% for heating, investing in higher SEER ratings and superior cooling technology delivers the best return on investment.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Columbus</h2>
<p>Columbus residents have access to several rebate programs that can significantly reduce HVAC upgrade costs. Federal tax credits offer up to \$2,000 for qualifying heat pumps and air conditioners with SEER2 ratings of 16+ (cooling) and HSPF2 ratings of 7.5+ (heating). Georgia Power provides rebates up to \$500 for ENERGY STAR qualified central air conditioners and heat pumps, plus additional incentives for smart thermostats (\$50-100). The state of Georgia offers income-qualified weatherization programs that can include HVAC upgrades at reduced costs. Additionally, financing programs through Georgia Power allow qualified customers to spread upgrade costs over time with on-bill financing. When combined, these programs can reduce total system costs by \$1,000 to \$3,000, making high-efficiency systems much more affordable for Columbus homeowners.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Columbus</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in Columbus requires careful vetting to ensure quality installation and service. Verify that contractors hold valid Georgia contractor licenses and EPA certifications for refrigerant handling. Look for contractors with specific experience in hot-humid climates who understand the importance of proper sizing, ductwork design, and humidity control. Request multiple detailed quotes that include equipment specifications, labor costs, and warranties. Quality contractors should provide comprehensive warranties covering parts (5-10 years) and labor (2-5 years), plus offer 24/7 emergency service given Columbus's demanding climate. Check Better Business Bureau ratings, Google reviews, and ask for local references. Reputable contractors will perform detailed load calculations, discuss ductwork inspection and sealing, and explain maintenance requirements specific to Georgia's climate challenges.</p>
