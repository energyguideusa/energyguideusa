const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Columbus</h2>
<p>Columbus, Georgia's hot-humid climate and abundant sunshine make it an excellent location for solar panel installations. With over 206,922 residents in Muscogee County paying Georgia Power's current rate of 11.9¢/kWh, homeowners have significant opportunities to reduce their electricity costs through solar energy. The city receives approximately 4.5-5.0 peak sun hours daily, providing optimal conditions for solar energy generation throughout most of the year.</p>

<p>The hot-humid climate in Columbus actually benefits solar panel performance during cooler months, while modern panels are designed to handle the intense summer heat efficiently. Georgia Power's net metering program allows Columbus residents to sell excess solar energy back to the grid, further enhancing the financial benefits of solar installation. With electricity rates continuing to rise and solar technology costs decreasing, now is an ideal time for Columbus homeowners to invest in solar panels.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Columbus</h2>
<p>Columbus residents can take advantage of several valuable solar incentives to reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit on the total cost of solar panel installation, including equipment and labor, through 2032. For a typical \$18,000 system, this translates to \$5,400 in tax savings. Georgia also offers property tax exemptions for solar installations, meaning the added home value from solar panels won't increase your property taxes. While Georgia Power doesn't currently offer direct rebates for residential solar, their net metering program allows customers to receive credits for excess energy produced, effectively providing ongoing financial benefits. Additionally, some local contractors may offer seasonal promotions or financing incentives that can further reduce upfront costs for Columbus homeowners.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Columbus</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in Columbus, prioritize companies with proper Georgia licensing, NABCEP certifications, and extensive local experience. Look for installers who are familiar with Georgia Power's interconnection requirements and local permitting processes in Muscogee County. The best solar companies will offer comprehensive warranties covering equipment (typically 20-25 years for panels, 10-12 years for inverters) and workmanship (minimum 5-10 years). Request multiple quotes and verify that installers carry proper insurance and bonding. Check references from recent Columbus installations and review Better Business Bureau ratings. Reputable companies will provide detailed energy production estimates based on your specific roof conditions and local weather patterns. They should also handle all permitting, utility interconnection paperwork, and post-installation monitoring setup to ensure optimal system performance.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Columbus</h2>
<p>Based on Columbus's electricity rate of 11.9¢/kWh and average solar installation costs, homeowners can expect a payback period of approximately 13-15 years for their solar investment. A typical 6kW system generating 8,400 kWh annually will save approximately \$936 per year at current rates. Over a 25-year system lifespan, total savings can reach \$23,400 before accounting for electricity rate increases, which historically average 2-3% annually. When factoring in rising energy costs, actual 25-year savings often exceed \$30,000. The return on investment becomes even more attractive when considering increased home values, as solar panels typically add 3-4% to property values in Georgia. With financing options available at competitive rates, many Columbus homeowners can achieve immediate positive cash flow, where monthly loan payments are less than monthly electricity savings from day one.</p>
