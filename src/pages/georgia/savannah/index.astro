const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Savannah, Georgia</h2>
<p>Savannah's hot-humid subtropical climate and abundant sunshine make it an ideal location for solar panel installations. With over 220 sunny days annually and summer temperatures regularly exceeding 90°F, homeowners in this historic city of 147,780 residents face substantial cooling costs that can be significantly reduced through strategic solar and HVAC upgrades. Georgia Power's current residential electricity rate of 12.2¢ per kWh means that a typical 1,850 square foot Savannah home can see monthly electric bills ranging from \$150-250 during peak summer months.</p>

<p>The combination of high cooling demands and favorable solar conditions creates a perfect opportunity for Savannah homeowners to achieve energy independence while reducing their carbon footprint. Chatham County's coastal location provides consistent solar irradiance levels of approximately 4.5-5.0 kWh/m²/day, while the hot-humid climate necessitates efficient HVAC systems that can handle both high temperatures and moisture levels. When properly integrated, solar panels can offset the increased electricity usage from air conditioning, making both investments more cost-effective for Savannah residents.</p>

<p>Solar installation costs in Savannah typically range from \$2.75 to \$3.25 per watt before incentives, with the average 1,850 square foot home requiring a 6-8kW system to offset electricity usage. Georgia Power's net metering program allows homeowners to receive credit for excess solar production at the full retail rate, making solar investments particularly attractive. The payback period for most Savannah installations ranges from 8-12 years, with systems providing 25+ years of clean energy production.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Savannah</h2>
<p>Savannah's hot-humid climate demands HVAC systems specifically designed to handle both temperature control and moisture management. The ideal system for Savannah homes should feature a minimum SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) rating of 16-18, with variable-speed compressors that can adjust output based on cooling demands. Heat pumps are particularly effective in Savannah's moderate winter climate, providing both heating and cooling while maintaining high efficiency year-round.</p>

<p>Dehumidification is crucial in Savannah's coastal environment, where humidity levels regularly exceed 70%. Multi-stage or variable-speed systems excel at removing moisture while maintaining comfortable temperatures, preventing mold growth and improving indoor air quality. Proper ductwork sizing and sealing is essential, as poorly designed duct systems can lose 20-30% of conditioned air in Savannah's hot attics. High-efficiency systems with SEER ratings of 18+ can reduce cooling costs by 30-40% compared to older units, making them ideal companions to solar panel installations.</p>

<h2>Savannah Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Savannah homeowners can take advantage of several incentive programs to reduce solar and HVAC upgrade costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on the total cost of solar panel installations through 2032, including equipment, labor, and permitting fees. This credit can be combined with Georgia's state tax credit for solar installations, which provides an additional credit of up to \$2,500 or 25% of the system cost, whichever is less.</p>

<p>Georgia Power offers rebates for high-efficiency HVAC equipment through their residential energy efficiency programs. Heat pump installations can qualify for rebates of \$250-500, while high-efficiency air conditioning systems may receive rebates of \$100-300. The utility also provides free energy audits and additional rebates for comprehensive home efficiency upgrades. Chatham County occasionally offers property tax exemptions for renewable energy installations, and federal tax credits are also available for qualifying HVAC equipment, including heat pumps and high-efficiency systems.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Savannah</h2>
<p>Historic Downtown Savannah presents unique challenges for solar installations due to historic preservation requirements and tree coverage, but many homeowners successfully install systems on carriage houses or less visible roof sections. The Victorian District and Thomas Square areas offer excellent solar potential with larger lot sizes and fewer restrictions, making them ideal for comprehensive solar and HVAC upgrades.</p>

<p>Suburban neighborhoods like Pooler, Richmond Hill, and the Islands area feature newer construction with optimal roof orientations for solar panels and modern electrical systems that easily accommodate solar installations. These areas also benefit from larger lot sizes that allow for ground-mount solar options when roof installations aren't feasible. Midtown and Ardsley Park neighborhoods offer a mix of historic charm and solar-friendly architecture, with many mid-century homes featuring suitable roof space and updated electrical systems. The Southside area, including neighborhoods near Oglethorpe Mall, provides excellent solar potential with minimal shading and straightforward installation requirements.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Savannah</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
