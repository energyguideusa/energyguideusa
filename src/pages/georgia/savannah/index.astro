const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Savannah, Georgia</h2>
<p>Savannah's hot-humid climate and favorable solar conditions make it an excellent location for both solar panel installations and efficient HVAC systems. With over 218 sunny days per year and Georgia's net metering policies, Savannah homeowners can significantly reduce their energy costs through solar power. The city's electricity rate of 12.2¢/kWh through Georgia Power is slightly above the national average, making solar investments particularly attractive for the 147,780 residents of this historic Chatham County city.</p>

<p>The combination of high cooling demands and abundant sunshine creates a perfect synergy between solar panels and HVAC systems in Savannah. During peak summer months when air conditioning usage is highest, solar panels produce maximum energy output, effectively offsetting the increased electricity consumption. For typical 1,850 square foot homes in Savannah, this pairing can result in substantial energy savings and improved home comfort while reducing dependence on Georgia Power's grid electricity.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in Savannah average \$3.10 per watt installed, which is competitive with Georgia's statewide average. These calculations assume annual production of 1,340 kWh per kW installed, based on Savannah's solar irradiance levels. With Georgia Power's net metering program, excess solar production is credited at the retail rate of 12.2¢/kWh, maximizing savings for homeowners. Most 1,850 square foot homes in Savannah require 6-8kW systems to offset their annual electricity usage effectively.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Savannah</h2>
<p>Savannah's hot-humid climate demands robust HVAC systems capable of handling both high temperatures and moisture control. The optimal HVAC system for Savannah homes should have a minimum SEER rating of 16, with high-efficiency units rated at 18-20 SEER providing the best long-term value. Heat pumps are particularly effective in Savannah's mild winter climate, offering both heating and cooling efficiency while working synergistically with solar panel systems.</p>

<p>For Savannah's climate, variable-speed air handlers and two-stage compressors are recommended to maintain consistent comfort while managing humidity levels. Proper dehumidification is crucial in this coastal environment, making systems with enhanced moisture removal capabilities essential. Ductless mini-split systems are also excellent options for historic Savannah homes where traditional ductwork installation may be challenging. When paired with solar panels, high-efficiency HVAC systems can operate during peak solar production hours, effectively using free solar electricity for cooling needs.</p>

<h2>Savannah Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Savannah homeowners benefit from several attractive incentives for solar and HVAC installations. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit for solar panel systems installed through 2032, which can save thousands of dollars on installation costs. This credit applies to the total system cost, including equipment, labor, and permits, making it one of the most valuable solar incentives available.</p>

<p>While Georgia doesn't offer state-level solar rebates, the state's net metering law requires Georgia Power to credit solar customers for excess electricity at full retail rates. Georgia Power also offers rebates for high-efficiency HVAC systems, including up to \$500 for ENERGY STAR certified heat pumps and air conditioners. Additionally, the state sales tax exemption on solar equipment saves customers an additional 4% on system costs. Property tax exemptions ensure that adding solar panels won't increase your home's assessed value for tax purposes, providing long-term financial benefits for Savannah homeowners.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Savannah</h2>
<p>Savannah's diverse neighborhoods each present unique opportunities and considerations for solar and HVAC installations. The Historic District, with its iconic antebellum architecture, requires careful planning for solar installations to comply with preservation guidelines, though many homeowners successfully install panels on rear-facing roofs or carports. Victorian District and Thomas Square homes often feature high ceilings and older construction, making high-efficiency HVAC systems particularly beneficial for comfort and energy savings.</p>

<p>Newer developments in Pooler and Richmond Hill offer ideal conditions for solar installations with modern roof designs and fewer restrictions. The Southside and Midtown areas feature a mix of housing styles, with many ranch-style homes providing excellent south-facing roof exposure for solar panels. Islands communities like Whitemarsh Island and Wilmington Island benefit from excellent solar exposure but may require additional consideration for salt air corrosion protection. Regardless of neighborhood, most Savannah homes can benefit from solar installations, with professional site assessments determining optimal system design and placement.</p>
