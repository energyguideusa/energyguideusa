const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Savannah</h2>
<p>Savannah's hot-humid subtropical climate presents unique challenges for homeowners, with sweltering summers reaching the mid-90s and high humidity levels that make temperatures feel even hotter. With 147,780 residents in Chatham County relying on air conditioning for comfort from April through October, choosing the right HVAC system is crucial for both comfort and energy efficiency. The extended cooling season means your air conditioning system will run approximately 2,500-3,000 hours annually, making energy efficiency a top priority.</p>

<p>At Georgia Power's current rate of 12.2¢/kWh, energy costs can quickly add up during Savannah's long cooling season. A typical 2,000 square foot home can expect to spend \$1,800-2,400 annually on cooling costs alone with a standard efficiency system. However, upgrading to a high-efficiency HVAC system can reduce these costs by 20-40%, making the investment worthwhile for long-term savings. The combination of high humidity and heat also requires systems with excellent dehumidification capabilities to maintain indoor air quality and prevent mold growth.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Savannah Climate</h2>
<p>For Savannah's hot-humid climate, heat pumps are often the optimal choice, providing both efficient cooling and adequate heating for the mild winters. Look for systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher and HSPF ratings of at least 9.0 for maximum efficiency. Variable-speed compressors are particularly beneficial in humid climates like Savannah's, as they run longer at lower speeds to better remove humidity while maintaining consistent temperatures. Two-stage or variable-speed systems also provide better dehumidification than single-stage units, which is crucial during Savannah's humid summer months when indoor humidity control is as important as temperature control.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Savannah</h2>
<p>Savannah homeowners can take advantage of several rebate programs to offset HVAC installation costs. The federal tax credit covers 30% of the cost for qualifying heat pumps and high-efficiency systems through 2032, then drops to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Georgia Power offers rebates up to \$300 for ENERGY STAR certified heat pumps and up to \$200 for high-efficiency air conditioning systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher. Additionally, Georgia's state energy efficiency programs occasionally offer additional incentives for HVAC upgrades, and low-income households may qualify for weatherization assistance programs that include HVAC improvements at reduced or no cost.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Savannah</h2>
<p>When selecting an HVAC contractor in Savannah, verify they hold a valid Georgia contractor's license and are insured and bonded. Look for contractors with extensive experience in hot-humid climates who understand the importance of proper sizing, ductwork design, and humidity control. Request multiple quotes and ensure each contractor performs a Manual J load calculation to properly size your system – oversized systems are common in Savannah and lead to poor humidity control and higher energy bills. Choose contractors who offer comprehensive warranties on both equipment and installation, provide 24/7 emergency service during peak summer months, and have strong local references from recent customers in the Chatham County area.</p>
