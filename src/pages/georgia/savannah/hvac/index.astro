const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Savannah</h2>
<p>Savannah's hot-humid climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, with sweltering summers reaching 90°F+ and high humidity levels that can make temperatures feel even hotter. The city's 147,780 residents rely heavily on air conditioning from April through October, making efficient cooling systems essential for comfort and manageable energy bills. With Georgia Power's electricity rate of 12.2¢/kWh, homeowners face significant cooling costs during peak summer months, often seeing bills exceed \$200-300 monthly without an efficient system.</p>

<p>The hot-humid climate in Chatham County demands HVAC systems that excel at both temperature control and humidity removal. Standard air conditioners must work overtime in Savannah's muggy conditions, while heat pumps offer year-round efficiency for the mild winters. Proper system sizing becomes critical – oversized units may cool quickly but fail to remove humidity, leaving homes feeling clammy and uncomfortable. Smart homeowners invest in higher SEER-rated systems and proper ductwork to combat the challenging coastal climate while keeping energy costs reasonable.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Savannah Climate</h2>
<p>For Savannah's hot-humid climate, HVAC systems should prioritize both cooling efficiency and dehumidification capabilities. The ideal system features a minimum 16 SEER rating, though 18+ SEER units provide better long-term value given the extended cooling season. Heat pumps work exceptionally well in Savannah, efficiently cooling during long summers while providing adequate heating for mild winters when temperatures rarely drop below 30°F. Variable-speed systems excel in humid conditions, running longer at lower speeds to remove more moisture while maintaining consistent temperatures. Two-stage compressors also perform well, offering enhanced humidity control compared to single-stage units. For optimal performance, systems should include enhanced dehumidification features, properly sized ductwork, and programmable thermostats to manage Georgia Power's time-of-use rates effectively.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Savannah</h2>
<p>Savannah residents can access multiple rebate programs to offset HVAC upgrade costs. Federal tax credits provide up to \$2,000 for qualifying heat pumps and central air systems with 16+ SEER ratings through 2032. Georgia offers additional state tax credits up to \$300 for Energy Star certified systems. Georgia Power provides rebates ranging from \$250-500 for high-efficiency heat pumps and air conditioners, plus additional incentives for smart thermostats (\$50-100) and proper ductwork improvements (\$200-400). The utility also offers financing programs with reduced interest rates for qualifying efficiency upgrades. Combined with federal programs, total rebates can reach \$2,500-3,000 for comprehensive system upgrades. Georgia Power's Peak Rewards program offers additional bill credits for customers who allow remote thermostat adjustments during high-demand periods, providing ongoing savings beyond initial rebates.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Savannah</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in Savannah requires careful vetting to ensure quality installation and service. Verify Georgia contractor licensing through the Secretary of State's website and confirm liability insurance and bonding. Look for contractors with extensive experience in hot-humid climates who understand proper system sizing and humidity control techniques. Quality contractors provide detailed load calculations rather than simple square footage estimates, ensuring optimal system performance. Check Better Business Bureau ratings, Google reviews, and ask for local references from recent customers. Reputable contractors offer comprehensive warranties (5-10 years on equipment, 1-2 years on labor) and provide 24/7 emergency service during Savannah's brutal summer months. Request multiple detailed quotes that include equipment specifications, installation procedures, and timeline commitments. Avoid door-to-door sales or unusually low bids that may indicate corner-cutting on installation quality or equipment standards.</p>
