const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Savannah</h2>
<p>Savannah's hot-humid climate and abundant sunshine make it an excellent location for solar panel installation. With over 2,100 hours of sunshine annually and Georgia Power's current electricity rate of 12.2¢/kWh, homeowners in Chatham County can achieve significant long-term savings through solar energy. The city's subtropical climate means consistent solar production year-round, though summer temperatures can reduce panel efficiency slightly during peak heat periods.</p>

<p>The 147,780 residents of Savannah are increasingly turning to solar as electricity costs continue to rise. Georgia Power's net metering program allows solar customers to sell excess electricity back to the grid, though at a reduced rate compared to retail prices. With proper system sizing and professional installation, most Savannah homeowners can expect to offset 80-100% of their annual electricity usage, making solar a compelling investment in this coastal Georgia market.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Savannah</h2>
<p>Savannah homeowners can take advantage of several solar incentives to reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on the total system cost through 2032, stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Georgia doesn't offer a state-level solar tax credit, but the state does exempt solar installations from property tax increases, meaning your home's added value from solar won't increase your property taxes. Georgia Power offers net metering, allowing customers to receive credit for excess energy produced, though the buyback rate is typically lower than retail rates. Additionally, solar equipment is exempt from Georgia's sales tax, providing immediate savings of 4-8% depending on local tax rates in Chatham County.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Savannah</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in Savannah, prioritize companies with proper Georgia licensing, NABCEP-certified installers, and extensive local experience with Georgia Power's interconnection requirements. Look for installers who offer comprehensive warranties covering equipment (typically 20-25 years for panels, 10-15 years for inverters) and workmanship (minimum 5-10 years). Top-rated companies in the Savannah market should provide detailed energy production estimates based on your specific roof conditions and local weather patterns, handle all permitting and utility paperwork, and offer financing options. Verify that contractors carry proper insurance and check references from recent Chatham County installations. Avoid door-to-door sales tactics and always get multiple quotes before making a decision.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Savannah</h2>
<p>Based on Savannah's 12.2¢/kWh electricity rates and average solar irradiance, most residential systems achieve payback periods of 11-13 years. A typical 6kW system costing \$12,180 after federal tax credits can save homeowners approximately \$1,025 annually, resulting in a payback period of just under 12 years. Over a 25-year system lifespan, total savings typically range from \$18,000-\$22,000, representing a strong return on investment. With Georgia Power's rates historically increasing 2-3% annually, actual savings often exceed projections. The hot-humid climate may reduce panel efficiency by 10-15% during peak summer months, but Savannah's year-round sunshine more than compensates. Property values typically increase by about 4% with solar installation, adding immediate equity to your home investment.</p>
