const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Savannah</h2>
<p>Savannah's hot-humid climate provides excellent conditions for solar energy generation, with the city receiving approximately 4.5-5.0 peak sun hours daily throughout the year. With Georgia Power's current electricity rate of 12.2¢/kWh serving the 147,780 residents of this Chatham County city, homeowners are increasingly turning to solar panels as a way to reduce their monthly energy bills and achieve long-term savings. The subtropical climate means air conditioning costs run high during Savannah's lengthy summer season, making solar panels particularly attractive for offsetting these peak energy usage periods.</p>

<p>Installing solar panels in Savannah requires careful consideration of the humid coastal environment, which demands high-quality materials and proper installation techniques to ensure longevity and performance. The city's relatively flat terrain and minimal shading from mountains make it ideal for solar installations, while Georgia Power's net metering program allows homeowners to sell excess energy back to the grid. Professional installers in the Savannah area are experienced in dealing with the coastal climate challenges, including salt air exposure and occasional severe weather events that require robust mounting systems and corrosion-resistant components.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Savannah</h2>
<p>Savannah homeowners can take advantage of several significant solar incentives to reduce their installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit on the total system cost through 2032, then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Georgia offers additional state-level support through property tax exemptions for solar installations, meaning the added home value from solar panels won't increase your property taxes. Georgia Power, the primary utility serving Savannah, participates in net metering programs that credit customers for excess solar energy fed back into the grid at the retail rate of 12.2¢/kWh. Additionally, some local Chatham County programs may offer additional rebates or financing options for renewable energy installations, making solar even more affordable for residents.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Savannah</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in Savannah, prioritize companies with proper Georgia licensing, NABCEP (North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners) certification, and extensive experience with coastal installations. Look for contractors who understand Savannah's specific climate challenges, including humidity, salt air, and hurricane preparedness requirements. The best installers will offer comprehensive warranties covering both equipment (typically 20-25 years on panels, 10-15 years on inverters) and workmanship (minimum 5-10 years). Verify that potential contractors carry proper insurance, have strong local references, and provide detailed proposals with system specifications, expected energy production, and financing options. Companies familiar with Georgia Power's interconnection requirements and local permitting processes in Chatham County will ensure smoother installations and faster approvals.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Savannah</h2>
<p>Based on Savannah's 12.2¢/kWh electricity rates and average solar irradiance, homeowners can expect a payback period of approximately 14-15 years for their solar investment. A typical 6kW system costing \$18,000 before incentives will generate roughly 7,200 kWh annually, saving about \$878 per year on electricity bills at current Georgia Power rates. After applying the 30% federal tax credit, the net investment of \$12,600 pays for itself in 14.4 years. Over the 25-year warranty period, this system would save approximately \$21,950 in electricity costs, representing a total return on investment of 274%. These calculations assume a 2% annual increase in electricity rates, which is conservative given historical trends. With Georgia Power's net metering and Savannah's excellent solar resource, most homeowners see positive cash flow within 15 years and substantial long-term savings.</p>
