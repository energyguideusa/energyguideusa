const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Georgia presents exceptional opportunities for both solar energy adoption and high-efficiency HVAC systems due to its favorable climate conditions and energy market characteristics. With an average of 4.9 sun hours per day throughout the state, Georgia ranks among the top southeastern states for solar energy production potential. The state's abundant sunshine, combined with relatively high electricity rates averaging 12.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, creates compelling economics for homeowners and businesses considering renewable energy investments.</p>

<p>Georgia Power, the state's primary utility provider serving over 2.6 million customers, has implemented several programs that support both solar adoption and energy efficiency improvements. The utility's net metering program allows solar customers to receive credit for excess electricity generated, while their demand-side management programs offer rebates for high-efficiency HVAC systems. Georgia's hot, humid summers and mild winters create significant cooling demands that can account for 50-70% of annual electricity usage, making the combination of solar panels and efficient HVAC systems particularly attractive for reducing energy costs.</p>

<p>The state's regulatory environment has become increasingly supportive of renewable energy, with policies that protect property owners' rights to install solar systems and tax incentives that improve project economics. Georgia's growing solar industry has also led to increased competition among installers and contractors, resulting in more competitive pricing for both solar installations and HVAC system upgrades across major metropolitan areas including Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, and Savannah.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in Georgia</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Georgia's solar resource is exceptionally strong throughout the state, with annual solar irradiance levels ranging from 4.5 to 5.2 peak sun hours per day depending on location. Southern Georgia counties including Valdosta, Tifton, and Brunswick typically see the highest solar production potential, while northern mountain regions around Dahlonega and Blue Ridge experience slightly lower but still excellent solar conditions. The state's relatively low latitude and minimal seasonal variation in daylight hours provide consistent year-round solar energy production, with summer months producing 20-25% more electricity than winter months.</p>

<p>A typical residential solar installation in Georgia can expect to generate between 1,200 and 1,400 kilowatt-hours per year for each installed kilowatt of solar capacity. This means a standard 6kW residential system would produce approximately 7,500-8,400 kWh annually, which can offset 60-80% of a typical Georgia home's electricity consumption. The state's clear skies and low precipitation during peak summer months maximize solar production precisely when air conditioning demands and electricity costs are highest.</p>

<p>Georgia's solar industry has experienced tremendous growth, with installed capacity increasing from less than 50 megawatts in 2013 to over 4,800 megawatts by 2023, making it the 8th largest solar market in the United States. This rapid expansion has created a mature installer network with competitive pricing and experienced technicians throughout the state. The Georgia Public Service Commission's renewable energy standards and Georgia Power's renewable energy programs have further supported this growth while maintaining grid stability and reliability.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems in Georgia</h2>

<h3>Climate Considerations</h3>
<p>Georgia's humid subtropical climate creates unique challenges and opportunities for HVAC system design and operation. The state experiences hot, humid summers with average temperatures reaching 85-90°F and humidity levels frequently exceeding 70%, creating substantial cooling loads that typically run from April through October. Winter heating requirements are relatively modest, with average low temperatures ranging from 35°F in northern Georgia to 45°F in southern coastal areas, meaning most homes require 3-4 times more cooling energy than heating energy annually.</p>

<p>The high humidity levels throughout Georgia make proper dehumidification a critical component of indoor comfort and air quality. HVAC systems must be properly sized and configured to remove moisture effectively while maintaining comfortable temperatures. Oversized systems that cycle on and off frequently often fail to adequately dehumidify, leading to comfort problems and potential indoor air quality issues. Variable-speed equipment and properly designed ductwork are particularly important in Georgia's climate to achieve optimal humidity control.</p>

<p>Georgia's long cooling season and high electricity rates during peak summer months make high-efficiency cooling systems particularly cost-effective. Heat pump systems are especially well-suited to Georgia's climate, providing efficient cooling during summer months and adequate heating during mild winter conditions. The state's minimal heating requirements mean that heat pumps can achieve excellent annual efficiency without the need for supplemental heating systems in most applications.</p>

<h2>Georgia Incentives & Rebates</h2>
<p>Georgia offers several attractive incentives that significantly improve the economics of both solar panel installations and high-efficiency HVAC systems. The federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit for solar installations through 2032, with the credit stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the total installed cost including equipment, labor, and permitting fees, making it one of the most valuable solar incentives available. For a typical \$25,000 solar installation, the federal tax credit provides \$7,500 in direct tax savings.</p>

<p>Georgia provides a valuable property tax exemption for solar energy systems, meaning the added value from solar panels does not increase property tax assessments. This exemption applies to both residential and commercial installations and remains in effect for the life of the system. Additionally, solar equipment purchases are exempt from state sales tax, providing immediate savings of 4-8% depending on local tax rates. These state-level incentives can save homeowners an additional \$1,000-2,000 on a typical residential solar installation.</p>

<p>Georgia Power offers several programs that benefit both solar customers and those installing efficient HVAC systems. The utility's net metering program credits solar customers at the full retail rate for excess electricity fed back to the grid, though new customers are subject to a monthly grid access fee. Georgia Power's Energy Efficiency rebate programs provide up to \$500 for qualifying high-efficiency heat pumps and air conditioning systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher. Municipal utilities including Georgia EMC cooperatives often offer additional rebates and time-of-use rates that can further improve savings for customers with solar and efficient HVAC systems.</p>

<p>The federal tax credit for HVAC systems applies to qualifying heat pumps, with credits up to \$2,000 for equipment meeting efficiency requirements under the Inflation Reduction Act. Additionally, Georgia homeowners may qualify for low-interest financing through the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority for energy efficiency improvements. Many Georgia utilities also offer on-bill financing programs that allow customers to pay for efficiency upgrades through their monthly utility bills, with payments often lower than the energy savings achieved.</p>
