const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Georgia presents an exceptional opportunity for both solar energy and HVAC system investments, making it one of the most attractive states in the Southeast for home energy improvements. With an average of 4.9 peak sun hours per day and abundant sunshine throughout the year, Georgia homeowners can generate substantial solar energy to offset their electricity consumption. The state's average electricity rate of 12.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, primarily served by Georgia Power, creates significant potential for long-term savings when combined with solar installations and efficient HVAC systems.</p>

<p>Georgia's humid subtropical climate presents unique challenges and opportunities for homeowners seeking to optimize their energy consumption. The state experiences hot, humid summers with cooling demands that can drive electricity bills significantly higher, while mild winters require modest heating needs. This climate pattern makes Georgia an ideal candidate for solar-powered HVAC systems, where peak solar production during summer months aligns perfectly with maximum air conditioning demands. The combination of strong solar resources, supportive state policies, and high cooling costs creates an environment where homeowners can achieve substantial energy savings through strategic investments in solar panels and high-efficiency HVAC systems.</p>

<p>The Georgia energy market has evolved to support renewable energy adoption, with net metering policies that allow homeowners to receive credit for excess solar production fed back into the grid. When paired with modern, efficient HVAC systems rated for Georgia's climate conditions, homeowners can dramatically reduce their dependence on grid electricity while maintaining optimal comfort year-round. The state's property tax exemption for solar installations, combined with federal incentives, makes the initial investment more accessible while ensuring long-term financial benefits through reduced utility costs.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in Georgia</h2>
<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Georgia's solar resource ranks among the top tier in the southeastern United States, with excellent conditions for photovoltaic energy generation throughout most of the state. The average daily solar irradiance ranges from 4.5 to 5.2 kWh/m²/day, with the highest values concentrated in the southern and central regions of the state. This translates to approximately 4.9 peak sun hours daily, meaning a typical residential solar installation can operate at full capacity for nearly five hours each day on average. Seasonal variations show peak production during April through September, when solar panels can generate 20-30% more electricity than during winter months.</p>

<p>A typical 6kW residential solar system in Georgia can be expected to produce between 7,500 and 8,500 kWh annually, depending on specific location, panel orientation, and system efficiency. South-facing installations with optimal tilt angles of 32-35 degrees achieve maximum production, though east and west-facing systems still provide excellent returns. The state's relatively moderate temperatures during peak solar months help maintain panel efficiency, as excessive heat can reduce photovoltaic performance. Georgia's solar production capacity remains strong even during partly cloudy conditions, thanks to advanced panel technology that can capture diffused sunlight effectively.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems in Georgia</h2>
<h3>Climate Considerations</h3>
<p>Georgia's humid subtropical climate creates specific demands for HVAC systems that must efficiently handle both cooling and dehumidification during the extended warm season while providing adequate heating during brief but sometimes intense cold periods. The state experiences approximately 2,500-3,500 cooling degree days annually and 1,500-3,000 heating degree days, with cooling representing roughly 60-70% of annual HVAC energy consumption for most homes. This cooling-dominated climate makes high-efficiency air conditioning systems essential for managing energy costs, particularly during July and August when temperatures regularly exceed 90°F with high humidity levels.</p>

<p>For optimal performance in Georgia's climate, HVAC systems should feature SEER ratings of at least 16-18, with higher ratings providing better long-term savings despite increased upfront costs. Heat pump systems are particularly well-suited to Georgia's moderate winter conditions, providing efficient heating when temperatures remain above 25°F, which covers the vast majority of winter days across the state. Variable-speed compressors and advanced humidity control features become crucial for maintaining comfort while managing the high moisture content typical of Georgia's air, especially in coastal regions where humidity levels can remain elevated even during cooler months.</p>

<h2>Georgia Incentives & Rebates</h2>
<p>Georgia offers several attractive incentives that make solar panel and HVAC system installations more affordable for homeowners. The most significant benefit comes from the federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which allows homeowners to deduct 30% of the total solar installation cost from their federal taxes. This credit applies to the full system cost, including equipment, installation, and associated electrical work, with no cap on the credit amount. The 30% rate remains in effect through 2032, then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034 before expiring for residential installations.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Federal 30% Solar Tax Credit:</strong> The most valuable incentive available, this credit can be carried forward to future tax years if it exceeds your current tax liability. For a typical \$24,000 solar installation, this provides \$7,200 in tax credits. The credit applies to solar panels, inverters, mounting equipment, installation labor, and any electrical work necessary to connect the system.</li>
<li><strong>State Property Tax Exemption:</strong> Georgia provides a complete exemption from property tax increases for residential solar installations. While your solar system may increase your home's value by \$15,000-\$20,000, you won't pay additional property taxes on this increased value, saving hundreds of dollars annually in many counties.</li>
<li><strong>Georgia Power Solar Buyback Program:</strong> Under net metering arrangements, Georgia Power customers receive credit for excess solar energy fed back into the grid at avoided cost rates. While lower than retail rates, this program ensures that all solar production provides economic value to homeowners.</li>
<li><strong>Local Utility Rebates:</strong> Many Georgia electric membership corporations (EMCs) offer rebates for high-efficiency HVAC systems and solar installations. These rebates typically range from \$200-\$1,000 for qualifying heat pumps and air conditioning systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher.</li>
<li><strong>USDA Rural Development Grants:</strong> Rural Georgia homeowners may qualify for USDA grants covering up to 25% of solar installation costs, with maximum grants of \$10,000. These grants can be combined with federal tax credits for maximum savings.</li>
</ul>
