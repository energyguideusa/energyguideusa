const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Spokane</h2>
<p>Spokane's cold continental climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, with winter temperatures often dropping below freezing and summer highs reaching into the 90s. The city's 228,989 residents in Spokane County require robust heating systems capable of maintaining comfort during harsh winters that can last from October through April. With significant temperature swings throughout the year, homeowners need versatile HVAC solutions that can efficiently handle both heating and cooling demands while managing energy costs effectively.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Spokane residents benefit from relatively low electricity rates at 9.8¢/kWh through Avista, making electric heat pumps and high-efficiency systems more economically attractive than in many other regions. This favorable rate structure, combined with Spokane's dry climate that reduces humidity-related cooling loads, creates opportunities for homeowners to invest in premium HVAC systems that deliver long-term savings. The key is selecting equipment designed to perform efficiently in cold weather while taking advantage of the area's moderate summer cooling requirements.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Spokane Climate</h2>
<p>For Spokane's cold climate, heat pumps with cold-weather capability are the optimal choice, particularly units rated for efficient operation down to -15°F or lower. Look for systems with SEER ratings of 16-18 and HSPF ratings of 9.0 or higher to maximize efficiency during the extended heating season. Ductless mini-split heat pumps are especially popular in Spokane, offering zoned comfort control and excellent efficiency for both heating and cooling. For homes requiring central air, consider variable-speed heat pumps with backup electric resistance heating or dual-fuel systems that switch to natural gas during extreme cold snaps. Given Spokane's heating-dominant climate, prioritize heating efficiency (HSPF) over cooling efficiency (SEER) when comparing systems, as you'll use heating functionality for roughly 6-7 months annually versus 2-3 months of cooling.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Spokane</h2>
<p>Spokane residents can access multiple rebate programs to offset HVAC installation costs. The federal tax credit provides up to \$2,000 for qualifying heat pumps and up to \$600 for central air conditioners that meet efficiency requirements. Washington state offers additional incentives through the Clean Buildings Performance Standard and various utility programs. Avista provides substantial rebates for energy-efficient HVAC upgrades, including up to \$1,000 for qualifying heat pumps, \$500-800 for high-efficiency central air systems, and \$300-500 for smart thermostats. Avista also offers low-interest financing options and energy audits to help identify the most cost-effective upgrades. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act provides point-of-sale rebates for income-qualified households, potentially covering up to \$8,000 for heat pump installations. Contact Avista directly or visit their website to verify current rebate amounts and eligibility requirements, as these programs are updated annually.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Spokane</h2>
<p>When selecting an HVAC contractor in Spokane, verify they hold current Washington state mechanical contractor licenses and are bonded and insured. Look for contractors with extensive cold-climate experience, particularly with heat pump installations and service in sub-zero conditions. Quality contractors should provide detailed load calculations, offer multiple system options with clear explanations of efficiency ratings, and provide written estimates with equipment specifications. Check Better Business Bureau ratings, Google reviews, and ask for local references from recent installations. Ensure the contractor offers comprehensive warranties covering both equipment and labor, typically 5-10 years on major components and 1-2 years on installation work. Priority should be given to contractors who provide 24/7 emergency service during Spokane's harsh winter months, offer maintenance agreements to keep systems running efficiently, and demonstrate knowledge of local utility rebate programs to maximize your savings. Request contractors to explain their approach to proper sizing and installation practices specific to Spokane's climate conditions.</p>
