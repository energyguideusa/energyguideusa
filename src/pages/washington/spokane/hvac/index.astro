const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Spokane</h2>
<p>Spokane's cold climate with harsh winters and moderate summers creates unique HVAC demands for the city's 228,989 residents. With average winter temperatures dropping below 30°F and summer highs reaching the mid-80s, homes require robust heating systems capable of handling extended cold periods while providing efficient cooling during warmer months. The heating season typically runs from October through April, making heating the primary concern for most homeowners in Spokane County.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Spokane residents benefit from relatively low electricity costs at 9.8¢/kWh through Avista utilities, making electric heat pumps and high-efficiency HVAC systems more economically viable than in many other regions. This competitive rate, combined with federal and state incentives, creates favorable conditions for upgrading to energy-efficient systems. The cold climate demands systems with strong heating capacity and good performance in freezing temperatures, making proper system selection critical for comfort and cost-effectiveness throughout Spokane's long winter season.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Spokane Climate</h2>
<p>For Spokane's cold climate, dual-fuel heat pump systems with gas backup provide the optimal balance of efficiency and reliability. Look for heat pumps with cold-climate ratings and SEER ratings of 16-18, paired with HSPF ratings of 9.0 or higher for heating efficiency. These systems use the heat pump during mild weather and automatically switch to gas heating when temperatures drop below 25-30°F, ensuring consistent comfort throughout winter. For homes without natural gas access, high-efficiency electric heat pumps with auxiliary electric heating strips work well, though operating costs will be higher during extreme cold snaps. Given Spokane's climate, prioritize heating performance over cooling efficiency - systems should maintain capacity down to at least 5°F outdoor temperature.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Spokane</h2>
<p>Spokane residents can access substantial savings through multiple rebate programs. Federal tax credits cover up to \$2,000 for qualifying heat pumps with SEER ratings of 16+ and HSPF 8.8+, while high-efficiency systems may qualify for 30% of installation costs under federal programs through 2024. Washington State offers additional rebates through the Energy Independence Act, providing up to \$1,500 for heat pump installations. Avista customers can receive rebates of \$500-800 for qualifying heat pumps and up to \$1,200 for ductless heat pump systems. The utility also offers low-interest financing programs and seasonal promotions that can reduce upfront costs by \$2,000-3,000. Income-qualified customers may access additional weatherization assistance and enhanced rebates through Avista's energy efficiency programs.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Spokane</h2>
<p>Select contractors licensed through Washington State Department of Labor & Industries with current HVAC contractor licenses and proper bonding and insurance. Look for contractors with specific experience in cold-climate installations and heat pump systems, as improper sizing or installation can significantly impact performance during Spokane winters. Request detailed load calculations and equipment specifications, ensuring contractors account for your home's insulation, windows, and local climate conditions. Quality contractors should offer comprehensive warranties covering both equipment and labor for minimum 5-10 years, provide 24/7 emergency service during heating season, and maintain manufacturer certifications for major brands. Check Better Business Bureau ratings, Google reviews, and verify membership in professional organizations like ACCA (Air Conditioning Contractors of America).</p>
