const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Spokane</h2>
<p>Spokane, Washington presents unique opportunities for solar panel installation despite its cold climate reputation. While the city experiences harsh winters, Spokane receives approximately 171 sunny days per year, providing sufficient solar irradiance for effective energy generation. The cold temperatures actually benefit solar panel efficiency, as photovoltaic cells perform better in cooler conditions. With Avista's current electricity rate of 9.8¢/kWh serving Spokane County's 228,989 residents, homeowners can realize significant savings through solar adoption, especially considering Washington's net metering policies that allow excess energy to be sold back to the grid.</p>

<p>The installation process in Spokane requires careful consideration of snow load requirements and proper panel positioning to maximize winter sun exposure. Local installers familiar with Spokane's building codes and climate conditions can design systems that withstand heavy snow loads while optimizing energy production throughout the year. Avista's interconnection process is streamlined for residential solar installations, making it easier for Spokane homeowners to connect their systems to the grid and begin generating clean energy while reducing their monthly electricity bills.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Spokane</h2>
<p>Spokane residents benefit from several solar incentives that significantly reduce installation costs. The federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit on the total system cost, including equipment and installation, through 2032. Washington state offers additional benefits through its renewable energy sales tax exemption, eliminating the 6.5% state sales tax on solar equipment purchases. Avista participates in Washington's net metering program, allowing customers to receive credit for excess solar energy fed back into the grid at the retail electricity rate of 9.8¢/kWh. Additionally, Spokane County may offer property tax exemptions for renewable energy systems, ensuring that adding solar panels doesn't increase your property tax assessment despite adding value to your home.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Spokane</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in Spokane, prioritize companies with proper Washington state electrical contractor licensing and NABCEP-certified installers who understand local climate challenges and building codes. Look for installers with extensive experience in cold-weather installations and knowledge of snow load calculations specific to Spokane's requirements. Quality installers should offer comprehensive warranties covering equipment (typically 20-25 years for panels, 10-15 years for inverters) and workmanship (minimum 10 years). Verify that potential contractors carry adequate insurance, provide detailed proposals with energy production estimates based on Spokane's solar irradiance data, and offer transparent pricing with no hidden fees. Check Better Business Bureau ratings, online reviews, and ask for local references from recent Spokane installations to ensure reliability and customer satisfaction.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Spokane</h2>
<p>Solar return on investment in Spokane varies based on system size and energy consumption patterns, but typically shows positive returns over the system's 25-year lifespan. With Avista's electricity rate of 9.8¢/kWh and average annual rate increases of 2-3%, a typical 6kW system costing \$13,230 after federal tax credits can generate approximately \$706 in annual savings. The payback period averages 18.7 years, after which homeowners enjoy essentially free electricity for the remaining system life. Over 25 years, total savings can reach \$17,650 to \$21,000 depending on utility rate increases and system performance. While Spokane's payback period is longer than sunnier climates, the combination of net metering, stable utility rates, and long-term energy cost protection makes solar a viable long-term investment for reducing electricity expenses and increasing energy independence.</p>
