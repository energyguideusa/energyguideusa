const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Tacoma</h2>
<p>Tacoma's marine climate presents unique HVAC challenges for the city's 219,346 residents in Pierce County. With mild, wet winters and relatively cool summers, homeowners need systems that can efficiently handle moderate heating loads while providing dehumidification during the damp Pacific Northwest months. The marine climate means temperatures rarely exceed 80°F in summer or drop below 35°F in winter, making heat pumps particularly effective year-round solutions.</p>

<p>Energy efficiency is especially important in Tacoma given the region's focus on sustainability and the advantage of Tacoma Power's competitive 9.9¢/kWh electricity rate. This rate is significantly lower than the national average, making electric heat pumps and high-efficiency HVAC systems more cost-effective to operate. The mild climate also means smaller capacity systems can often meet comfort needs, reducing both installation costs and ongoing energy consumption compared to systems needed in more extreme climates.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Tacoma Climate</h2>
<p>For Tacoma's marine climate, heat pumps with SEER ratings of 16-18 and HSPF ratings of 9.0 or higher offer the best performance. Unlike areas with harsh winters, Tacoma's mild temperatures allow heat pumps to operate efficiently year-round without backup heating systems. Ductless mini-split heat pumps are particularly popular, offering zone control and high efficiency ratings up to 22 SEER. For homes with existing ductwork, ducted heat pump systems provide excellent whole-house comfort. The heating load typically outweighs cooling needs, with most energy consumption occurring during the October through April heating season. Variable-speed systems work exceptionally well in marine climates, maintaining consistent humidity control during the frequent light rain and overcast conditions that characterize Tacoma weather.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Tacoma</h2>
<p>Tacoma residents can access substantial rebates through multiple programs. Federal tax credits provide up to \$2,000 for qualifying heat pump installations through 2032. Washington State's Clean Energy Fund offers additional incentives for high-efficiency systems, often providing \$500-1,500 rebates for ENERGY STAR certified equipment. Tacoma Power, the city's municipal utility, runs aggressive rebate programs including up to \$1,200 for ductless heat pump installations and \$800 for high-efficiency ducted systems. They also offer \$75 rebates for smart thermostats and financing programs with reduced interest rates for qualifying HVAC upgrades. Low-income households may qualify for additional weatherization assistance through Pierce County programs, sometimes covering up to 100% of system replacement costs.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Tacoma</h2>
<p>When selecting an HVAC contractor in Tacoma, verify they hold current Washington State contractor licenses and carry proper insurance coverage. Look for contractors experienced with marine climate challenges, including moisture management and proper system sizing for mild Pacific Northwest conditions. Quality contractors should provide detailed load calculations, offer multiple equipment options, and explain rebate programs available through Tacoma Power. Check Better Business Bureau ratings and recent customer reviews, particularly focusing on warranty service and response times during Tacoma's peak heating season. Reliable contractors offer emergency service guarantees and maintain strong relationships with major equipment manufacturers. Request multiple quotes but evaluate based on total value including equipment quality, warranty coverage, and ongoing service support rather than just initial price.</p>
