const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Vancouver, Washington</h2>
<p>Vancouver, Washington offers excellent opportunities for both solar panel installation and HVAC system optimization. With a population of 190,915 residents in Clark County, Vancouver's marine climate provides moderate temperatures year-round, making it ideal for energy-efficient home systems. The city's electricity rate of 10.1¢/kWh through Clark Public Utilities is relatively affordable compared to national averages, but solar panels can still provide substantial long-term savings while reducing environmental impact.</p>

<p>The marine climate in Vancouver means residents experience mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers, creating specific energy needs that can be effectively addressed through strategic solar and HVAC investments. With average home sizes of 1,880 square feet, homeowners have ample roof space for solar installations while requiring right-sized HVAC systems to maintain comfort efficiently. Clark Public Utilities' net metering program allows solar panel owners to sell excess energy back to the grid, maximizing the financial benefits of solar investment in Vancouver.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in Vancouver typically range from \$3.00 to \$3.50 per watt before incentives. For a typical 1,880 square foot home, a 6-8kW system provides optimal energy production. With Vancouver receiving approximately 4.2 peak sun hours daily on average, these systems can generate significant electricity throughout the year. The payback period for solar installations in Vancouver averages 14-17 years, making them a solid long-term investment for homeowners planning to stay in their homes.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Vancouver</h2>
<p>Vancouver's marine climate requires HVAC systems that can efficiently handle moderate heating needs in winter and cooling requirements during summer months. Heat pumps are particularly well-suited for this climate, as they can provide both heating and cooling efficiently when temperatures rarely drop below freezing. For Vancouver homes, heat pumps with SEER ratings of 16-20 and HSPF ratings of 9-10 offer optimal efficiency. Gas furnaces paired with central air conditioning units should have AFUE ratings of at least 90% and SEER ratings of 16 or higher to maximize energy savings.</p>

<p>Due to Vancouver's mild climate, ductless mini-split systems are increasingly popular, offering zone-controlled comfort and exceptional efficiency. These systems work particularly well in the 1,880 square foot average home size, allowing homeowners to heat and cool only occupied spaces. During Vancouver's wet winters, proper humidity control becomes essential, making systems with integrated humidity management valuable investments for maintaining indoor air quality and comfort.</p>

<h2>Vancouver Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Vancouver residents can take advantage of multiple incentive programs for solar and HVAC installations. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit for solar panel systems installed through 2032, significantly reducing upfront costs. Washington State offers additional incentives including sales tax exemptions on solar equipment and renewable energy production incentives through the Renewable Energy System Cost Recovery Program.</p>

<p>Clark Public Utilities provides rebates for energy-efficient HVAC systems, including up to \$800 for qualifying heat pumps and \$400 for high-efficiency air conditioning units. The utility also offers weatherization rebates up to \$500 for insulation and air sealing improvements that complement HVAC efficiency. Additionally, Vancouver residents may qualify for low-interest financing through Washington State's Clean Energy Fund and various federal programs that make solar and HVAC upgrades more affordable.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Vancouver</h2>
<p>Vancouver's diverse neighborhoods each present unique opportunities for solar and HVAC installations. The Fruit Valley area, with its mix of older and newer homes, often benefits from HVAC upgrades and solar retrofits on well-positioned roofs. Downtown Vancouver's urban core features condominiums and townhomes where ductless mini-split systems excel, while solar installations may require community solar options due to shared roof spaces.</p>

<p>The Minnehaha neighborhood, known for larger single-family homes, typically offers excellent roof space for comprehensive solar arrays and benefits from whole-home HVAC solutions. East Vancouver's newer developments often come solar-ready with optimal roof orientations and modern electrical systems. Riverside neighborhoods like Columbia River Gorge areas may face additional wind considerations for HVAC sizing, while taking advantage of excellent solar exposure. Each neighborhood's tree coverage, home age, and architectural styles influence the optimal approach to solar panel placement and HVAC system selection.</p>

<h2>Best Solar and HVAC Contractors in Vancouver</h2>
<p>Selecting qualified contractors is crucial for successful solar and HVAC installations in Vancouver. Look for solar installers certified by NABCEP (North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners) with experience in Washington State regulations and Clark Public Utilities' interconnection requirements. Top contractors should provide detailed site assessments, considering Vancouver's occasional cloudy weather patterns and optimal panel positioning for year-round production.</p>

<p>For HVAC contractors, seek professionals licensed by Washington State Department of Labor and Industries with expertise in marine climate systems. Quality contractors will perform Manual J load calculations specific to Vancouver's climate data and recommend appropriately sized equipment for your home's 1,880 square foot average. They should also be familiar with Clark Public Utilities' rebate programs and can help homeowners navigate the application process for maximum savings.</p>
