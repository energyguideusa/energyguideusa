const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Washington state presents a compelling opportunity for homeowners interested in solar panels and HVAC system upgrades, despite its reputation for cloudy weather. With an average of 3.7 sun hours per day, Washington receives more solar irradiance than many realize, particularly in eastern regions where annual sunshine can exceed 2,400 hours. The state's relatively low electricity rates at 9.7¢/kWh, primarily supplied by Puget Sound Energy and other regional utilities, make energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy investments particularly attractive from both environmental and financial perspectives.</p>

<p>Washington's temperate oceanic climate creates unique opportunities for HVAC optimization, with mild summers requiring minimal cooling and moderate winters where efficient heating systems can dramatically reduce energy consumption. The state's commitment to renewable energy, combined with abundant hydroelectric power, creates an ideal environment for solar integration and high-efficiency HVAC systems. Homeowners can expect significant long-term savings when combining solar installations with modern heat pump systems, particularly given the state's generous incentive programs and the 30% federal solar tax credit.</p>

<p>The diverse geography across Washington means energy needs vary considerably between regions. Western areas like Seattle and Tacoma experience milder temperatures year-round but receive less direct sunlight, while eastern cities like Spokane enjoy more sunny days but face greater temperature extremes. This variation makes proper system sizing and equipment selection crucial for maximizing energy savings and return on investment across the state's different climate zones.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in Washington</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Washington's solar resource is more robust than commonly perceived, with the state receiving between 3.5-5.5 peak sun hours daily depending on location. Eastern Washington, including cities like Spokane and the Tri-Cities area, enjoys significantly higher solar irradiance levels than western regions, often exceeding 4.5 peak sun hours daily. Even western Washington, including Seattle and Tacoma, receives adequate solar radiation for viable installations, averaging 3.2-3.7 peak sun hours annually.</p>

<p>Seasonal variations are pronounced across Washington, with summer months (June-August) providing 6-8 hours of peak sun exposure daily, while winter months drop to 1-2 hours. This seasonal pattern means solar systems typically produce 70-80% of their annual energy during the six-month period from April through September. A typical 6kW solar system in western Washington can generate 6,500-7,500 kWh annually, while the same system in eastern Washington may produce 8,000-9,500 kWh due to increased solar irradiance and clearer skies.</p>

<p>Washington's moderate temperatures actually benefit solar panel efficiency, as photovoltaic systems perform better in cooler conditions. The state's average annual temperature of 50°F helps maintain optimal panel operating temperatures, often resulting in 5-10% higher efficiency compared to hotter climates. Additionally, Washington's relatively clean air and minimal dust accumulation mean panels require less maintenance and maintain peak performance longer than in many other regions.</p>
