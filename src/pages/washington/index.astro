const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Washington state presents a compelling opportunity for homeowners considering solar panels and HVAC system upgrades, despite common misconceptions about the region's solar viability. With an average of 3.7 sun hours per day, Washington receives more solar radiation than many people realize, particularly during the long summer days when the state can experience up to 16 hours of daylight. The combination of relatively low electricity rates at 9.7¢ per kWh and strong environmental consciousness makes renewable energy investments increasingly attractive for Washington residents seeking energy independence and reduced carbon footprints.</p>

<p>Puget Sound Energy, serving as the primary utility provider for much of western Washington, has implemented net metering programs and renewable energy incentives that complement federal tax credits, creating favorable conditions for solar adoption. The state's moderate climate also makes it ideal for high-efficiency HVAC systems, particularly heat pumps that can provide both heating and cooling while operating efficiently in Washington's temperate conditions. The mild summers reduce cooling demands compared to other regions, while the cool, wet winters benefit from modern heating technologies that can significantly reduce energy consumption.</p>

<p>The convergence of supportive state policies, including sales tax exemptions for solar equipment, federal incentives, and utility programs, creates a robust ecosystem for renewable energy investments. Washington's commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 further supports the long-term value proposition of solar and efficient HVAC systems, making now an optimal time for homeowners to consider these upgrades that will provide decades of benefits.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in Washington</h2>
<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Washington's solar potential often surprises newcomers who associate the state primarily with cloudy, rainy weather. While western Washington does experience significant cloud cover during winter months, the state's northern latitude provides exceptionally long summer days that maximize solar energy production. Cities like Seattle average 3.4 peak sun hours daily, while eastern Washington communities like Spokane and the Tri-Cities region can achieve 4.0-4.5 peak sun hours annually due to their drier climate and higher elevation.</p>

<p>A typical 6kW solar system in Washington can generate approximately 6,500-7,500 kWh annually, depending on location, system orientation, and local weather patterns. This production level can offset 60-80% of an average household's electricity consumption. The key to maximizing solar production in Washington lies in proper system design, including optimal panel placement to capture available sunlight during shorter winter days while maximizing the abundant summer solar resource. Modern solar panels perform efficiently even in cloudy conditions, generating 10-25% of their rated capacity on overcast days, which helps maintain consistent energy production throughout Washington's varied seasons.</p>

<p>Seasonal variations are more pronounced in Washington than in sunnier states, with summer months producing 3-4 times more solar energy than winter months. However, net metering policies allow homeowners to bank excess summer production as credits to offset winter electricity usage, effectively using the grid as a seasonal battery. This arrangement makes solar financially viable even with the seasonal production variations characteristic of the Pacific Northwest climate.</p>
