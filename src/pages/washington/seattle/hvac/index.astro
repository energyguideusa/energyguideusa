const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Seattle</h2>
<p>Seattle's marine climate creates unique HVAC requirements for the city's 749,256 residents across King County. The Pacific Northwest's mild, wet winters and relatively cool summers mean that heating systems work harder than air conditioning units, with most energy consumption occurring during the 6-month heating season from October through March. The marine climate brings high humidity levels year-round, making proper ventilation and dehumidification crucial for indoor air quality and preventing mold growth in homes and businesses.</p>

<p>With Seattle Light providing electricity at 10.2¢/kWh—well below the national average—electric heat pumps and high-efficiency systems become particularly cost-effective for Seattle homeowners. The moderate temperatures rarely drop below 35°F or rise above 80°F, making heat pump technology ideal since these systems maintain high efficiency in Seattle's temperature range. This climate advantage, combined with relatively low electricity costs, means residents can achieve significant energy savings with properly sized and installed HVAC systems designed for marine climate conditions.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Seattle Climate</h2>
<p>Heat pumps represent the optimal HVAC solution for Seattle's marine climate, with ductless mini-split systems gaining particular popularity in the region. A heat pump with a minimum 16 SEER cooling rating and 9.0 HSPF heating rating provides excellent year-round efficiency, while 18+ SEER units offer premium performance for larger homes. Since Seattle experiences minimal extreme temperatures, heat pumps maintain efficiency throughout the year without requiring backup heating systems that are necessary in colder climates. For cooling needs, Seattle homes typically require only 1-2 tons of capacity due to the mild summers, making right-sizing crucial to prevent short cycling and humidity issues. Traditional furnaces paired with separate AC units are becoming less common as heat pump technology advances, though gas furnaces remain viable for homes with existing natural gas infrastructure and those seeking backup heating redundancy.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Seattle</h2>
<p>Seattle residents can access multiple rebate programs to offset HVAC installation costs, starting with federal tax credits of up to \$2,000 for heat pumps and 30% of installation costs for qualified systems through 2032. Seattle Light offers substantial rebates including \$800-1,500 for ductless heat pumps, \$500-1,000 for central heat pumps, and \$75 per ton for high-efficiency air conditioners. Washington State's additional incentive programs provide sales tax exemptions on energy-efficient equipment, potentially saving hundreds of dollars on system purchases. The Puget Sound Energy rebate programs also serve some Seattle-area residents with rebates up to \$1,200 for premium efficiency heat pumps. Low-income households may qualify for weatherization programs that provide free or heavily subsidized HVAC upgrades through the Washington State Department of Commerce, making energy-efficient systems accessible across all income levels in King County.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Seattle</h2>
<p>Selecting a qualified HVAC contractor in Seattle requires verifying Washington State licensing through the Department of Labor & Industries, ensuring they hold current electrical and HVAC specialty licenses for the work scope. Look for contractors with specific experience in marine climate installations who understand moisture management, proper ventilation requirements, and heat pump sizing for Pacific Northwest conditions. Top contractors offer comprehensive warranties covering both equipment (5-10 years) and labor (2-5 years), plus emergency service availability during Seattle's occasional weather extremes. Request multiple quotes that include detailed load calculations, ductwork assessments, and energy efficiency projections based on your home's specific characteristics. Verify insurance coverage, Better Business Bureau ratings, and recent customer references, while prioritizing contractors who provide ongoing maintenance programs to protect your investment in Seattle's humid climate conditions.</p>
