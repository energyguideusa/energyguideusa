const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Seattle</h2>
<p>Seattle's marine climate presents unique considerations for solar panel installation, with the city receiving approximately 2,170 hours of sunshine annually despite its reputation for cloudy weather. While Seattle experiences fewer peak sun hours than sunnier states, solar panels can still generate substantial savings given Seattle Light's electricity rate of 10.2¢/kWh. The moderate temperatures year-round actually benefit solar panel efficiency, as panels perform better in cooler conditions compared to extremely hot climates.</p>

<p>Seattle Light customers in King County have access to net metering programs that credit excess solar energy fed back into the grid at retail rates. With Seattle's population of 749,256 increasingly focused on sustainability, solar installations have grown significantly. The marine climate's mild temperatures and consistent daylight during summer months create favorable conditions for solar energy production, making it a viable investment for homeowners looking to reduce their dependence on the grid and lower their monthly electricity bills.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Seattle</h2>
<p>Seattle residents can take advantage of the federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which provides a 30% tax credit on the total cost of solar panel installation through 2032. Washington State offers additional incentives including sales tax exemptions on solar equipment and the Renewable Energy Production Incentive, which has provided payments for solar energy production. Seattle Light participates in net metering programs, allowing customers to receive credit for excess energy their solar panels produce and feed back into the grid. Property owners should also note that solar panel installations are exempt from property tax increases in Washington State, meaning the added home value from solar panels won't increase your property taxes. Local rebates and financing options are periodically available through Seattle Light and regional energy efficiency programs.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Seattle</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in Seattle, prioritize companies with proper Washington State electrical contractor licensing and NABCEP (North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners) certified installers. Look for local experience specifically with Seattle's building codes, permitting processes, and Seattle Light's interconnection requirements. Top-rated installers should offer comprehensive warranties covering equipment (typically 20-25 years for panels, 10-15 years for inverters) and workmanship (minimum 5-10 years). Request multiple quotes and verify references from recent installations in King County. Reputable companies will provide detailed energy production estimates based on your specific roof orientation, shading conditions, and Seattle's solar irradiance data. Ensure the installer handles all permitting and utility interconnection paperwork, and ask about monitoring systems to track your solar system's performance over time.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Seattle</h2>
<p>Based on Seattle Light's 10.2¢/kWh electricity rate and average solar production in the marine climate, typical solar installations achieve payback periods of 16-19 years. A 6kW system costing \$13,020 after the federal tax credit can save approximately \$734 annually, leading to break-even around year 18. Over a 25-year period, the same system could generate total savings of \$18,350, providing a solid return on investment. Factors that can improve ROI include rising electricity rates (Seattle Light rates have increased an average of 2-3% annually), higher energy consumption during peak production hours, and optimal roof conditions facing south with minimal shading. While Seattle's payback periods are longer than sunnier states, the moderate marine climate extends equipment life and maintains consistent performance. Property value increases of 3-4% are typical with solar installations, providing additional financial benefits beyond electricity savings.</p>
