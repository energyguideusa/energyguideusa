<h2>Solar Panels in Delaware</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Delaware's solar resource potential is robust despite its small geographical footprint, with the state receiving approximately 4.5 peak sun hours per day on average throughout the year. This solar irradiance level places Delaware in a favorable position compared to many northeastern states, with seasonal variations ranging from about 3.2 hours in December to 5.8 hours in June. The state's relatively flat terrain and coastal location minimize shading obstacles while providing consistent atmospheric conditions that support reliable solar energy production.</p>

<p>A typical residential solar installation in Delaware can generate between 1,100 to 1,400 kilowatt-hours per installed kilowatt annually, depending on system orientation, tilt angle, and local shading conditions. South-facing installations with optimal tilt angles of 30-40 degrees perform best, though east and west-facing arrays can still achieve 85-90% of optimal production. Delaware's net metering policy allows excess solar production to be credited at full retail value, making even slightly sub-optimal installations economically viable for most homeowners.</p>

<p>The state's Green Energy Program, administered by the Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility (SEU), provides grants and rebates for renewable energy and efficiency improvements. Solar installations can qualify for additional state incentives of up to \$4,500 for residential systems, with the exact amount depending on system size and household income levels. The program also offers low-interest financing options that can help homeowners manage upfront costs while maximizing long-term savings.</p>

<p>Delmarva Power participates in various energy efficiency programs that provide rebates for high-efficiency HVAC equipment. Heat pump installations can qualify for rebates ranging from \$300-800, depending on efficiency ratings and system type. The utility also offers time-of-use rate structures that can maximize savings for customers with solar panels, allowing them to sell excess daytime production at peak rates while purchasing evening electricity at lower off-peak rates.</p>

<p>Property tax exemptions for solar installations ensure that adding solar panels won't increase property tax assessments, even though solar systems typically increase home values. Delaware also offers sales tax exemptions for solar equipment, reducing the total system cost by an additional 6.75%. These combined incentives can reduce the total cost of solar installations by 40-50%, dramatically improving payback periods and long-term returns on investment.</p>
