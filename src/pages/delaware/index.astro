const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Delaware presents an exceptional opportunity for homeowners looking to invest in solar panels and upgrade their HVAC systems. With an average of 4.5 peak sun hours per day and electricity rates averaging 12.1¢ per kilowatt-hour through Delmarva Power, the state's primary utility provider, Delaware residents can achieve substantial energy savings through renewable energy adoption. The state's compact geography and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean create a moderate climate that's ideal for both solar energy generation and efficient HVAC operation throughout the year.</p>

<p>Delaware's humid subtropical climate, characterized by hot, humid summers and mild winters, creates the perfect conditions for maximizing both solar energy production and HVAC efficiency. Summer temperatures typically range from 75-85°F, while winter temperatures rarely drop below 30°F, meaning homeowners need balanced heating and cooling solutions. The state's progressive energy policies, including participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and various green energy programs, provide additional financial incentives that make solar and HVAC investments even more attractive.</p>

<p>The combination of Delaware's favorable solar irradiance levels, competitive electricity rates, and comprehensive incentive programs creates an environment where homeowners can expect payback periods of 8-12 years for solar installations and 5-10 years for high-efficiency HVAC systems. With Delmarva Power serving over 500,000 customers across the state, the utility company has implemented various programs to support renewable energy adoption and energy efficiency improvements, making Delaware one of the most solar-friendly states on the East Coast.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in Delaware</h2>
<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Delaware receives excellent solar irradiance throughout the year, with peak production occurring during the summer months when the state experiences the highest electricity demand for air conditioning. The state's location at 39°N latitude provides optimal sun angles for fixed solar panel installations, typically mounted at 30-35 degree tilts facing south. Delaware's relatively flat terrain and minimal shading from mountains or other geographic features ensure consistent solar exposure across most residential properties.</p>

<p>Seasonal variations in Delaware show summer peak production of 5.2-5.8 kWh per installed kW, while winter production averages 2.8-3.5 kWh per installed kW. This seasonal pattern aligns well with electricity usage patterns, as summer cooling demands typically exceed winter heating requirements. A typical 6kW residential solar system in Delaware can produce between 7,200-8,400 kWh annually, covering 70-90% of an average household's electricity consumption. The state's net metering policies allow excess production to be credited at full retail rates, maximizing the financial benefits of solar installation.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems in Delaware</h2>
<h3>Climate Considerations</h3>
<p>Delaware's humid subtropical climate requires HVAC systems that can efficiently handle both heating and cooling demands throughout the year. Summer cooling loads typically account for 55-65% of annual HVAC energy consumption, with high humidity levels requiring effective dehumidification capabilities. The state's moderate winter temperatures make heat pumps an excellent choice, as they can provide efficient heating even when temperatures drop to 25-30°F, which occurs infrequently in Delaware.</p>

<p>For optimal performance in Delaware's climate, HVAC systems should have a minimum SEER rating of 16 for air conditioning and a Heating Seasonal Performance Factor (HSPF) of at least 9.0 for heat pumps. High-efficiency systems with SEER ratings of 18-22 provide the best long-term value, especially when paired with variable-speed compressors that can adjust output based on actual demand. Proper humidity control is crucial, with systems requiring dehumidification capabilities to maintain indoor humidity levels between 40-50% during Delaware's humid summer months.</p>

<h2>Delaware Incentives & Rebates</h2>
<p>Delaware offers a comprehensive array of incentives and rebates that significantly reduce the cost of solar panel and HVAC installations. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) allows homeowners to deduct 30% of the cost of installing a solar energy system from their federal taxes through 2032. This credit applies to the total system cost, including equipment, installation, and associated electrical work. There are no caps on the credit amount, and unused credits can be rolled over to future tax years.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Federal 30% Solar Tax Credit:</strong> Available through 2032, this credit covers solar panels, inverters, mounting equipment, wiring, and installation costs. The credit steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034 before expiring for residential installations.</li>
<li><strong>Delaware Green Energy Program:</strong> Provides grants up to \$4,500 for solar installations on residential properties, with additional funding available for low-to-moderate income households. The program also offers rebates for energy storage systems and electric vehicle charging stations.</li>
<li><strong>Delmarva Power Rebates:</strong> The utility offers rebates up to \$750 for high-efficiency HVAC systems, \$200-400 for programmable thermostats, and additional incentives for home energy audits and weatherization improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Net Metering:</strong> Delaware's net metering program allows solar system owners to receive full retail credit for excess electricity fed back into the grid, effectively using the grid as a battery for surplus solar production.</li>
<li><strong>Property Tax Exemption:</strong> Solar energy systems are exempt from property taxes in Delaware, meaning the added home value from solar installation won't increase property tax bills.</li>
</ul>
