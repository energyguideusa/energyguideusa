const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Delaware presents exceptional opportunities for both solar panel installations and high-efficiency HVAC systems, making it an ideal state for homeowners looking to reduce energy costs and environmental impact. With an average of 4.5 peak sun hours per day, Delaware receives substantial solar radiation throughout the year, particularly during the summer months when air conditioning demands are highest. The state's moderate coastal climate, influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay, creates optimal conditions for solar energy generation while requiring balanced heating and cooling solutions.</p>

<p>Delaware's electricity rates average 12.1¢ per kWh, which is slightly above the national average, making solar energy and efficient HVAC systems highly cost-effective investments for homeowners. Delmarva Power serves as the primary utility provider for most of the state, offering net metering programs that allow solar panel owners to sell excess electricity back to the grid at retail rates. This combination of favorable solar conditions, competitive electricity rates, and supportive utility policies creates significant opportunities for energy savings through both solar installations and modern HVAC upgrades.</p>

<p>The state's commitment to clean energy is evident through various incentive programs and rebates that make solar and HVAC investments more affordable. Delaware's Green Energy Program, combined with federal tax credits and utility rebates, can substantially reduce the upfront costs of these energy-efficient home improvements. For Delaware homeowners, the synergy between solar panels and high-efficiency HVAC systems offers the potential for dramatic reductions in monthly energy bills while increasing property values and reducing carbon footprints.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in Delaware</h2>
<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Delaware's solar resource is remarkably consistent throughout the state due to its relatively small geographic area and coastal location. The First State receives approximately 4.5 peak sun hours daily on average, with summer months reaching up to 6.5 peak sun hours and winter months averaging around 3.2 peak sun hours. This solar irradiance translates to excellent electricity production potential, with a typical 6kW residential solar system generating between 7,200 and 8,400 kWh annually. The state's flat topography and minimal shading from mountains or major geographic features allow for optimal solar panel positioning throughout most residential areas.</p>

<p>Delaware's coastal climate provides additional benefits for solar panel performance. The moderate temperatures help maintain optimal panel efficiency, as solar panels actually produce more electricity in cooler conditions. The frequent ocean breezes help keep panels clean and cool, reducing the efficiency losses that can occur in extremely hot climates. Additionally, Delaware's relatively low snowfall means minimal winter production losses, and the state's sunny spring and fall seasons extend the high-production period beyond just the summer months.</p>

<p>Net metering policies in Delaware are particularly favorable, allowing solar panel owners to receive full retail credit for excess electricity sent back to the grid. This means that during peak production hours, homeowners can build up credits that offset their electricity usage during evening hours or cloudy days. Delmarva Power's net metering program has no size restrictions for residential systems, making larger installations financially viable for homeowners with higher energy consumption or those looking to future-proof their homes for electric vehicles or other electrification upgrades.</p>
