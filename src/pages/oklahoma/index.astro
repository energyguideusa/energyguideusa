const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Oklahoma presents exceptional opportunities for both solar energy and high-efficiency HVAC systems, making it an ideal state for homeowners looking to reduce energy costs and increase property value. With an average of 5.1 peak sun hours per day and abundant sunshine throughout the year, Oklahoma ranks among the top states for solar energy potential. The state's relatively low electricity rates of approximately 10.5¢ per kWh, primarily served by Oklahoma Gas & Electric (OG&E), provide a solid foundation for calculating solar savings and return on investment.</p>

<p>Oklahoma's continental climate presents unique challenges and opportunities for both solar and HVAC systems. The state experiences hot, humid summers with temperatures regularly exceeding 95°F, requiring substantial cooling capacity, while winters can bring freezing temperatures and occasional ice storms, necessitating reliable heating systems. This climate pattern creates significant energy demand during peak summer months, making solar energy particularly valuable when electricity usage is highest. The combination of excellent solar resources and substantial cooling loads creates an ideal scenario for homeowners to maximize their energy savings through strategic solar and HVAC investments.</p>

<p>The state's commitment to renewable energy, coupled with federal incentives and local utility programs, creates a favorable environment for solar adoption. Oklahoma's sales tax exemption for solar equipment, combined with the federal 30% investment tax credit, can significantly reduce the upfront costs of solar installations. Additionally, the state's net metering policies allow homeowners to receive credit for excess electricity generated by their solar systems, further enhancing the economic benefits of solar energy in Oklahoma.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in Oklahoma</h2>
<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Oklahoma's solar irradiance levels consistently rank among the nation's best, with most areas of the state receiving between 4.8 to 5.4 peak sun hours daily on average. The state's location in the south-central United States provides excellent solar exposure year-round, with minimal seasonal variation compared to northern states. Summer months typically see 6-7 peak sun hours per day, while winter months still maintain respectable levels of 3.5-4.5 hours daily. This consistency makes Oklahoma particularly attractive for solar investments, as energy production remains relatively stable throughout the year.</p>

<p>A typical 5kW solar system in Oklahoma can generate approximately 6,500-7,500 kWh annually, depending on location, system orientation, and equipment quality. Systems facing south with optimal tilt angles of 30-35 degrees perform best, though east and west-facing installations can still achieve 85-90% of optimal production. The state's relatively low humidity and clear skies contribute to higher system efficiency, as solar panels perform better in dry conditions. Oklahoma's weather patterns, including occasional severe storms, require proper installation techniques and high-quality mounting systems to ensure long-term durability and performance.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems in Oklahoma</h2>
<h3>Climate Considerations</h3>
<p>Oklahoma's continental climate demands HVAC systems capable of handling both intense summer heat and occasional winter cold snaps. The state's cooling season typically runs from May through September, with July and August presenting the greatest challenges as temperatures frequently exceed 95°F with high humidity levels. During these peak months, air conditioning systems may run 12-16 hours daily, making energy efficiency crucial for controlling utility costs. The heating season, while shorter and less intense, still requires reliable systems capable of handling temperatures that can drop below 20°F during winter storms.</p>

<p>For Oklahoma homes, HVAC professionals typically recommend systems with SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) ratings of 16-18 for optimal balance between efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Higher SEER units, while more expensive upfront, can provide substantial savings during Oklahoma's long, hot summers. Heat pump systems are particularly well-suited to Oklahoma's climate, as they can efficiently provide both heating and cooling. Dual-fuel systems, combining heat pumps with gas furnaces, offer excellent performance and efficiency by automatically switching between electric and gas based on outdoor temperatures and utility rates.</p>

<h2>Oklahoma Incentives & Rebates</h2>
<p>Oklahoma homeowners have access to several valuable incentives that can significantly reduce the cost of solar and HVAC installations. The cornerstone of solar incentives is the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which allows homeowners to claim 30% of their solar system costs as a direct credit against their federal income taxes. This credit applies to all system components including panels, inverters, mounting equipment, and installation labor. The 30% rate is available through 2032, after which it steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034 before expiring for residential installations.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Federal Solar Investment Tax Credit:</strong> The 30% federal tax credit can be claimed for solar installations completed through 2032. This credit has no cap and can be carried forward to future tax years if it exceeds current tax liability. The credit applies to all qualifying solar equipment and installation costs, potentially saving Oklahoma homeowners \$3,000-8,000 or more depending on system size.</li>
<li><strong>Oklahoma Sales Tax Exemption:</strong> Oklahoma provides a complete exemption from state sales tax on solar energy equipment, including panels, inverters, batteries, and installation materials. This exemption can save homeowners an additional 4.5% on equipment costs, representing savings of \$500-1,500 on typical residential installations.</li>
<li><strong>OG&E Solar Rebate Programs:</strong> Oklahoma Gas & Electric offers various rebate programs for energy-efficient equipment and renewable energy systems. Their residential solar rebate program provides up to \$1,000 for qualified solar installations, subject to program availability and funding. OG&E also offers net metering, allowing customers to receive credit for excess electricity fed back into the grid.</li>
<li><strong>HVAC Efficiency Rebates:</strong> Many Oklahoma utilities, including OG&E, offer rebates for high-efficiency HVAC equipment. These rebates typically range from \$300-800 for qualifying heat pumps and air conditioning systems with SEER ratings of 16 or higher. Some programs also provide additional incentives for smart thermostats and duct sealing services.</li>
<li><strong>Property Tax Considerations:</strong> While Oklahoma doesn't offer specific property tax exemptions for solar installations, the increase in property value from solar systems is generally modest compared to the energy savings generated, making the investment attractive from a tax perspective.</li>
</ul>
