<h2>HVAC Systems in Minnesota</h2>
<h3>Climate Considerations</h3>
<p>Minnesota's harsh continental climate demands robust HVAC systems capable of handling extreme temperature variations throughout the year. Heating requirements dominate energy consumption, with most homes needing heating from October through April. The state's heating degree days average over 7,000 annually, significantly higher than national averages, making heating efficiency paramount for controlling energy costs. Natural gas remains the predominant heating fuel, though electric heat pumps are gaining popularity as technology improves and electricity rates remain competitive.</p>

<p>For cooling requirements, Minnesota experiences moderate summer conditions with occasional heat waves reaching the 90s.
