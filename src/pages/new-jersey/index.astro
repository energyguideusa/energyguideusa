const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>New Jersey presents exceptional opportunities for both solar energy and HVAC system investments, making it one of the most attractive states in the Northeast for renewable energy adoption. With an average of 4.3 sun hours per day and electricity rates averaging 15.6¢ per kilowatt-hour, homeowners can achieve significant savings through solar panel installations. The state's primary utility provider, PSE&G (Public Service Electric & Gas), along with other regional utilities, offers robust net metering programs that allow solar customers to sell excess energy back to the grid at retail rates.</p>

<p>The Garden State's humid subtropical climate in the south and humid continental climate in the north creates year-round energy demands that make efficient HVAC systems essential. Summers typically see temperatures reaching the mid-80s with high humidity, requiring substantial cooling, while winters can drop below freezing with significant heating needs. This climate pattern means New Jersey homeowners use both heating and cooling extensively, making energy-efficient HVAC systems paired with solar power an ideal combination for maximizing utility savings.</p>

<p>The state's commitment to clean energy, evidenced by its goal to achieve 100% clean electricity by 2035, has created a favorable regulatory environment with strong incentive programs. New Jersey's Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) program, combined with federal tax credits and utility rebates, can reduce the total cost of solar installations by 50% or more. Additionally, the state's relatively high property values mean that solar installations typically increase home values significantly, making the investment both environmentally and financially beneficial for Garden State residents.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in New Jersey</h2>
<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>New Jersey receives approximately 4.3 peak sun hours daily on average, with significant seasonal variation that affects solar energy production throughout the year. During summer months, the state can experience up to 5.5 peak sun hours daily, while winter months typically see around 3.0-3.5 hours. This solar irradiance translates to excellent production potential, with a typical 6kW residential system generating between 7,200-8,400 kWh annually, which covers 80-100% of average household electricity consumption.</p>

<p>The state's geographic location provides optimal solar conditions, with most areas receiving between 1,350-1,450 kWh per kW installed annually. Northern counties like Sussex and Warren may see slightly lower production due to increased cloud cover and elevation, while southern counties including Cape May and Cumberland often achieve higher production rates. Seasonal performance varies considerably, with summer months producing 40-50% more energy than winter months, making battery storage or net metering crucial for year-round energy independence.</p>

<p>Solar panel orientation and tilt significantly impact production in New Jersey's climate. South-facing installations with tilts between 30-40 degrees typically achieve optimal performance, though southeast and southwest orientations can still produce 90-95% of optimal output. The state's relatively stable weather patterns, with occasional severe weather events, make it suitable for durable solar installations that can withstand nor'easters and occasional hurricane impacts with proper mounting and equipment selection.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems in New Jersey</h2>
<h3>Climate Considerations</h3>
<p>New Jersey's diverse climate zones require HVAC systems capable of handling both significant cooling loads in summer and substantial heating demands in winter. The state experiences hot, humid summers with temperatures frequently reaching 85-90°F and high humidity levels that can make it feel even warmer. Winters are cold, with temperatures often dropping into the 20s and occasional periods below zero, particularly in northern counties. This dual-season demand means New Jersey homeowners need efficient systems for both heating and cooling.</p>

<p>For cooling systems, SEER ratings of 16-18 are recommended for optimal efficiency in New Jersey's climate. Higher SEER units (20+) may provide additional savings but often have longer payback periods given the state's moderate cooling season. Heat pumps are increasingly popular due to their dual functionality and efficiency, particularly cold-climate heat pumps that maintain efficiency down to -5°F. For areas with existing natural gas infrastructure, high-efficiency gas furnaces (90-95% AFUE) paired with efficient central air conditioning provide reliable, cost-effective climate control.</p>

<p>Humidity control is crucial in New Jersey, making variable-speed systems and proper ductwork design essential for comfort and efficiency. Whole-house dehumidification systems are often recommended to maintain indoor humidity levels between 30-50%, preventing mold growth and improving comfort while reducing cooling loads. Proper sizing is critical – oversized systems cycle frequently, failing to remove humidity effectively, while undersized systems struggle to maintain comfort during peak conditions.</p>

<h2>New Jersey Incentives & Rebates</h2>
<p>New Jersey offers comprehensive incentive programs that significantly reduce the cost of solar and energy-efficient HVAC installations. The federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) remains the most substantial incentive, providing a 30% tax credit for solar installations through 2032, then stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the total system cost, including equipment, installation, and permitting, and can be carried forward if it exceeds your tax liability in the installation year.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Federal 30% Solar Tax Credit:</strong> Available for solar panel systems, battery storage, and solar water heating systems. The credit applies to federal income taxes and includes all system components and installation costs. Homeowners can claim the credit the year their system is installed and operational, and unused portions can be rolled over to subsequent tax years.</li>
<li><strong>Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) Program:</strong> New Jersey's Successor Solar Incentive Program provides long-term revenue streams for solar owners. Systems receive SRECs based on actual production, with current values ranging from \$65-85 per certificate. A typical 7kW system generates 8-10 SRECs annually, providing \$520-850 in additional income for 15 years.</li>
<li><strong>PSE&G Energy Efficiency Programs:</strong> The state's largest utility offers rebates up to \$1,500 for high-efficiency heat pumps, \$800 for ENERGY STAR central air conditioners, and \$400 for smart thermostats. Commercial customers can access custom incentives for larger systems and comprehensive energy audits.</li>
<li><strong>New Jersey Clean Energy Program Rebates:</strong> Provides rebates for efficient HVAC equipment, including up to \$1,200 for geothermal systems, \$500 for ductless mini-splits, and \$300 for high-efficiency furnaces. These rebates stack with utility programs and federal tax credits for maximum savings.</li>
<li><strong>Local Utility Programs:</strong> Atlantic City Electric, JCP&L, and Rockland Electric offer additional rebates for efficient equipment. Many municipalities provide property tax exemptions for solar installations, and some offer expedited permitting processes to reduce soft costs.</li>
</ul>
