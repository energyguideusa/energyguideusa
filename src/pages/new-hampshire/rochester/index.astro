<p>For Rochester's average 1,720 square foot homes, a 6-8kW solar system typically provides optimal coverage for most households' electricity needs. The high electricity rate of 19.4¢/kWh from Eversource means that each kilowatt-hour generated by your solar panels saves you nearly 20 cents compared to purchasing from the grid. Installation costs in Rochester are competitive with state averages, and the 30% federal tax credit significantly reduces the upfront investment, making solar an attractive long-term investment for homeowners.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Rochester</h2>
<p>Rochester's cold climate demands robust heating systems capable of maintaining comfortable indoor temperatures during harsh New Hampshire winters. For this climate zone, heat pumps with backup heating systems are increasingly popular, particularly cold-climate heat pumps that can operate efficiently even when outdoor temperatures drop below freezing. These systems typically feature SEER ratings of 16-20 for cooling efficiency and HSPF ratings of 9-12 for heating performance.</p>

<p>Traditional heating options remain viable in Rochester, including high-efficiency natural gas furnaces (90%+ AFUE), oil furnaces, and boiler systems. For air conditioning, central air systems with SEER ratings of at least 16 are recommended to balance efficiency with performance during summer months. Ductless mini-split systems are excellent for homes without existing ductwork or for supplemental heating and cooling in specific zones. Given Rochester's climate, proper insulation and air sealing should accompany any HVAC upgrade to maximize efficiency and comfort while minimizing energy costs from Eversource.</p>

<h2>Rochester Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Rochester residents have access to several valuable energy incentives that make solar and HVAC upgrades more affordable. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit for solar panel installations through 2032, then decreases to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the total system cost, including equipment, installation, and permits, making it one of the most valuable incentives available to homeowners.</p>

<p>New Hampshire offers additional state-level incentives, including net metering through Eversource that allows solar customers to receive credit for excess electricity they generate and send back to the grid. Eversource also provides rebates for energy-efficient HVAC equipment, including heat pump systems, programmable thermostats, and high-efficiency heating and cooling equipment. The utility's Energy Star rebate program can provide several hundred dollars in rebates for qualifying HVAC systems. Additionally, Rochester residents may qualify for low-interest financing through the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission's energy efficiency programs, making it easier to finance both solar and HVAC improvements with manageable monthly payments.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Rochester</h2>
<p>Rochester's diverse neighborhoods each present unique opportunities and considerations for solar and HVAC installations. The downtown area features a mix of historic homes and newer construction, with older properties often benefiting most from HVAC system upgrades due to less efficient existing heating systems. These homes may require ductwork modifications or could be excellent candidates for ductless mini-split systems that don't require extensive renovations.</p>

<p>The Gonic village area, with its established residential neighborhoods, typically features homes with good solar exposure and adequate roof space for solar panel installations. Many homes in this area are well-suited for 6-8kW solar systems that can offset most of their Eversource electricity usage. The East Rochester and North Rochester areas, which include many newer developments, often have homes already equipped with relatively modern HVAC systems that may benefit from efficiency upgrades rather than complete replacements. These neighborhoods also tend to have optimal roof orientations for solar installations, with many homes featuring south-facing roof sections ideal for maximum solar energy production throughout the year.</p>
