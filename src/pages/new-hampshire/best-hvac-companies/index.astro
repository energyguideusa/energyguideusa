const content = `<h2>How to Choose the Best HVAC Company in New Hampshire</h2>
<p>Finding the right HVAC company in New Hampshire requires careful consideration of the state's unique climate challenges and demanding seasonal variations. New Hampshire homeowners face frigid winters with temperatures often dropping well below freezing, followed by humid summers that can strain cooling systems. The best HVAC contractors in the Granite State understand these extreme seasonal demands and can recommend systems that handle both efficient heating during long winters and reliable cooling during peak summer months.</p>

<p>A top-tier New Hampshire HVAC company should demonstrate expertise in energy-efficient heating solutions, given that heating costs represent the largest portion of most homeowners' energy bills. They should be knowledgeable about various heating options including natural gas, oil, propane, and electric systems, as well as newer technologies like heat pumps that are becoming increasingly viable in New Hampshire's climate. Additionally, the best contractors will have extensive experience with proper insulation, ductwork design, and humidity control systems that are essential for maintaining comfortable indoor environments year-round.</p>

<p>Beyond technical expertise, exceptional HVAC companies in New Hampshire prioritize customer service, transparent pricing, and long-term relationships with their clients. They understand that HVAC emergencies don't follow business hours, especially during harsh winter storms or unexpected heat waves, and they're prepared to respond quickly when systems fail during critical weather conditions.</p>

<h2>Key Factors to Consider</h2>

<h3>Licensing and Certifications</h3>
<p>In New Hampshire, HVAC contractors must be properly licensed through the New Hampshire Department of Labor. Any contractor performing HVAC work should hold a valid New Hampshire contractor's license and carry appropriate insurance coverage. Look for technicians with North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification, which demonstrates their competency in installation, service, and repair of heating and cooling systems. EPA certifications are also crucial, particularly for technicians handling refrigerants, as federal law requires proper certification for anyone working with these materials. Don't hesitate to ask for proof of licensing and insurance, and verify these credentials independently through state databases.</p>

<h3>Experience and Specialization</h3>
<p>New Hampshire's harsh climate demands experienced professionals who understand how extreme weather affects HVAC systems. Look for companies with at least five years of experience serving New Hampshire customers, as they'll have encountered the full range of challenges that local weather conditions present. Consider whether you need installation specialists for new construction, repair experts for older systems, or maintenance professionals for ongoing service. Some companies excel in all areas, while others may specialize. Companies familiar with New Hampshire's building codes, local utility programs, and regional climate patterns will provide more valuable service than those without local experience.</p>

<h3>Warranties and Service Plans</h3>
<p>New Hampshire homeowners should expect comprehensive warranty coverage that includes both equipment and labor warranties. Equipment warranties typically come from manufacturers and can range from 5-12 years for major components, while labor warranties should be provided by the contractor for at least one year on installation work. Many reputable companies offer extended labor warranties of 2-5 years, demonstrating confidence in their workmanship. Maintenance plans are particularly valuable in New Hampshire's demanding climate, as regular tune-ups can prevent costly breakdowns during peak heating and cooling seasons. These plans often include priority service, discounted repairs, and annual system inspections that help identify potential problems before they become emergencies.</p>

<h3>Emergency Service</h3>
<p>Given New Hampshire's extreme weather conditions, 24/7 emergency service availability is not a luxury—it's a necessity. When temperatures drop to dangerous levels or heat waves create health risks, waiting until normal business hours for HVAC repairs isn't an option. The best HVAC companies offer true emergency service with reasonable response times, typically within 2-4 hours for genuine emergencies. Ask about their emergency service policies, additional charges for after-hours calls, and how they prioritize emergency calls. Companies that provide emergency service year-round, including holidays and weekends, demonstrate their commitment to customer safety and comfort.</p>

<h2>Red Flags to Avoid</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No proper licensing or insurance documentation</li>
  <li>Unwillingness to provide written estimates or contracts</li>
  <li>Pressure to buy oversized systems without proper load calculations</li>
  <li>No references or online reviews from local customers</li>
  <li>Cash-only payment requirements or demands for full payment upfront</li>
  <li>Door-to-door solicitation or high-pressure sales tactics</li>
  <li>Significantly lower bids than other contractors without clear explanations</li>
  <li>Reluctance to explain warranty terms or service policies</li>
  <li>No permanent business address or local phone number</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions to Ask HVAC Companies</h2>
<p>Asking the right questions helps you evaluate potential HVAC contractors and ensures you make an informed decision. These questions will help you assess their qualifications, business practices, and ability to meet your specific needs. Don't be afraid to ask detailed questions—professional contractors will welcome the opportunity to demonstrate their expertise and professionalism.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are you licensed and insured in New Hampshire, and can you provide proof?</li>
  <li>What certifications do your technicians have (NATE, EPA, manufacturer certifications)?</li>
  <li>Do you provide written estimates with detailed breakdowns of costs?</li>
  <li>What warranties do you offer on equipment and labor?</li>
  <li>Do you offer 24/7 emergency service, and what are the associated costs?</li>
  <li>Can you provide references from New Hampshire customers with similar projects?</li>
  <li>How do you determine proper system sizing for New Hampshire's climate?</li>
  <li>What maintenance plans do you offer, and what do they include?</li>
  <li>How long have you been serving New Hampshire customers?</li>
  <li>What financing options are available for installations?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting and Comparing Quotes</h2>
<p>Obtaining multiple quotes is essential for making an informed decision about your HVAC investment. Contact at least three reputable contractors for estimates, ensuring they all perform on-site evaluations rather than providing quotes over the phone. When comparing quotes, look beyond the bottom line price and examine SEER ratings for cooling efficiency and AFUE ratings for heating efficiency. Higher-rated systems cost more initially but provide significant long-term energy savings, which is particularly important in New Hampshire's extreme climate. Pay attention to system sizing calculations—properly sized systems operate more efficiently and last longer than oversized units. Compare warranty terms, installation quality details, and any additional services included in the price. Remember that the lowest bid isn't always the best value if it compromises on equipment quality, installation standards, or service support.</p>

<h2>New Hampshire-Specific Considerations</h2>
<p>New Hampshire's climate presents unique challenges that require specialized knowledge and equipment selection. The state experiences significant temperature extremes, from sub-zero winter temperatures to summer highs in the 80s and 90s, meaning HVAC systems must perform reliably across a wide range of conditions. Heating is typically the primary concern, as New Hampshire homeowners can expect heating seasons lasting 6-7 months annually. This makes heating system efficiency and reliability paramount. Humidity control is another critical factor, as New Hampshire experiences high humidity levels during summer months that can affect comfort and indoor air quality. Energy efficiency should be a top priority given New Hampshire's higher-than-average energy costs. Many New Hampshire utilities offer rebates and incentives for high-efficiency HVAC systems, and knowledgeable contractors can help you take advantage of these programs to offset installation costs.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="space-y-4 my-6">
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">How do I know if my HVAC contractor is licensed in New Hampshire?</h3>
    <p>You can verify a contractor's license through the New Hampshire Department of Labor's online database or by calling their office directly. All legitimate HVAC contractors should readily provide their license number and be willing to show proof of current licensing and insurance. Never work with unlicensed contractors, as this can void equipment warranties and create liability issues.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">What SEER rating should I get in New Hampshire?</h3>
    <p>For New Hampshire's climate, a SEER rating between 14-16 typically provides the best balance of efficiency and cost-effectiveness. While higher SEER ratings offer greater efficiency, the moderate cooling demands in most of New Hampshire may not justify the additional cost of ultra-high efficiency units. Focus more on heating efficiency (AFUE ratings) since heating represents the majority of your annual energy usage.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Should I repair or replace my HVAC system?</h3>
    <p>Consider replacement if your system is over 15 years old, requires frequent repairs, or has significantly higher energy bills. In New Hampshire's demanding climate, older systems often struggle with efficiency and reliability. If repair costs exceed 50% of replacement cost, or if your system uses R-22 refrigerant (being phased out), replacement is usually the better long-term investment. A qualified contractor can perform an evaluation to help you make this decision based on your specific situation.</p>
