const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Dover, New Hampshire</h2>
<p>Dover, New Hampshire presents excellent opportunities for solar energy adoption and efficient HVAC systems. With Eversource electricity rates at 19.4¢/kWh—significantly higher than the national average—Dover residents can achieve substantial savings through solar panel installations. The city's location in Strafford County provides adequate solar irradiance despite New Hampshire's northern latitude, making solar investments financially attractive for the community's 32,741 residents.</p>

<p>Dover's cold climate creates unique considerations for both solar and HVAC systems. While winter temperatures can be harsh, modern solar panels actually perform more efficiently in cold weather, and snow reflection can boost energy production. The combination of high electricity rates from Eversource and New Hampshire's net metering policies creates an ideal environment for solar adoption. Additionally, Dover's cold winters make efficient heating systems crucial for managing energy costs, particularly given the area's above-average electricity rates.</p>

<p>Solar panel costs in Dover reflect regional pricing with installation costs averaging \$3.20-\$3.30 per watt. With Dover's average home size of 1,620 square feet, most residents find that a 6-8kW system adequately covers their electricity needs. The high Eversource rates of 19.4¢/kWh mean faster payback periods, typically 8-10 years for most installations. Dover's solar potential averages 4.2 peak sun hours daily, generating approximately 1,200 kWh annually per installed kilowatt.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Dover</h2>
<p>Dover's cold climate requires robust heating systems capable of maintaining comfort during harsh New Hampshire winters. Heat pumps are increasingly popular, with cold-climate models like those from Mitsubishi, Daikin, and Carrier performing efficiently down to -15°F. For Dover homes, we recommend systems with SEER ratings of 16+ and HSPF ratings of 9.5+ to maximize efficiency against high Eversource electricity rates.</p>

<p>Traditional heating options remain viable in Dover, including natural gas furnaces and boilers where gas lines are available. However, with Dover's high electricity costs, air-source heat pumps with backup heating provide excellent year-round efficiency. Ductless mini-split systems work particularly well in Dover's older homes, many of which lack existing ductwork. For new construction or major renovations, ducted heat pump systems with variable-speed technology offer optimal comfort and efficiency for Dover's climate zone 6A conditions.</p>

<h2>Dover Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Dover residents have access to multiple solar and HVAC incentives that significantly reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on total solar installation costs through 2032, then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to all solar equipment, installation labor, and related electrical work, representing thousands in savings for Dover homeowners.</p>

<p>New Hampshire offers additional state-level benefits including property tax exemptions for solar installations and net metering through Eversource. While New Hampshire doesn't currently offer cash rebates for solar, the state's net metering policy allows Dover residents to receive full retail credit for excess solar production. For HVAC systems, federal tax credits up to \$2,000 are available for qualifying heat pumps, and Eversource occasionally offers rebates for high-efficiency heating and cooling equipment. Dover residents should also check for periodic rebate programs through the New Hampshire Saves initiative.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Dover</h2>
<p>Dover's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. The historic downtown area features many older homes with challenging roof configurations but often benefits from mature tree removal that improves solar access. Neighborhoods like Bellamy Fields and Dover Point offer newer construction with south-facing roof orientations ideal for solar panel placement and modern HVAC systems.</p>

<p>The Garrison Hill area features a mix of housing types, with many homes requiring HVAC upgrades to handle Dover's temperature extremes efficiently. Wentworth Acres and other suburban developments typically have excellent solar potential due to minimal shading and optimal roof angles. Rural areas around Dover may face additional considerations for electrical connections but often have unlimited solar exposure. Waterfront properties near the Cochecho River may need specialized equipment to handle humidity and salt air exposure.</p>

<h2>Best Solar & HVAC Contractors in Dover</h2>
<p>Selecting qualified contractors is crucial for Dover solar and HVAC installations. Look for NABCEP-certified solar installers with experience in New Hampshire's building codes and weather conditions. Reputable Dover-area solar companies should provide detailed energy production estimates, warranty information, and references from local installations. Many contractors serve Dover from nearby Portsmouth, Rochester, and Manchester.</p>

<p>For HVAC work, choose contractors licensed in New Hampshire with experience in cold-climate heat pump installations. The best Dover HVAC contractors offer load calculations, ductwork assessments, and maintenance plans. Many offer combined solar and HVAC services, which can streamline permitting and installation coordination. Always verify licensing, insurance, and Better Business Bureau ratings before signing contracts.</p>
