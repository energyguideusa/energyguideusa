const content = `<h2>How to Choose the Best Solar Company in New Hampshire</h2>
<p>Selecting the right solar installer in New Hampshire requires careful consideration of factors unique to the Granite State's climate, regulations, and market conditions. New Hampshire's four distinct seasons, including snowy winters and variable weather patterns, demand experienced installers who understand how to design and install systems that will perform optimally year-round. The state's net metering policies and interconnection standards also require installers to be well-versed in local utility requirements and permitting processes.</p>

<p>A great solar installer in New Hampshire should combine technical expertise with local knowledge, offering transparent pricing, quality equipment, and comprehensive warranties. They should be licensed by the New Hampshire Electricians' Board, maintain proper insurance coverage, and demonstrate a track record of successful installations throughout the state. The best companies will also stay current with New Hampshire's evolving solar policies and help customers navigate available incentives while ensuring installations meet all state and local building codes.</p>

<h2>Key Factors to Consider</h2>

<h3>Licensing and Certifications</h3>
<p>In New Hampshire, solar installers must hold a valid electrical contractor license issued by the New Hampshire Electricians' Board, as solar installation is considered electrical work under state law. Additionally, look for installers with North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) certification, which is the gold standard for solar installation professionals. NABCEP-certified installers have demonstrated comprehensive knowledge of solar technology, safety practices, and installation techniques. Some installers may also hold specialized certifications from equipment manufacturers, which can indicate advanced training on specific solar panels or inverters.</p>

<h3>Experience and Track Record</h3>
<p>Experience matters significantly in New Hampshire due to the state's challenging weather conditions and specific building requirements. Look for installers with at least three to five years of experience specifically in New Hampshire, as they'll understand local building codes, permitting processes, and how to design systems that can withstand heavy snow loads and ice dams. Experienced installers will also have established relationships with local utilities for interconnection processes and understand the nuances of New Hampshire's net metering program. Ask potential installers about their experience with installations similar to your property type and roof configuration.</p>

<h3>Warranties and Guarantees</h3>
<p>New Hampshire homeowners should expect comprehensive warranty coverage that includes both equipment and workmanship guarantees. Equipment warranties typically cover solar panels for 20-25 years and inverters for 10-25 years, depending on the manufacturer. Equally important is the workmanship warranty, which should cover installation quality for at least 10 years. Given New Hampshire's harsh winters, ensure your installer offers warranties that specifically address weather-related issues and includes coverage for roof penetrations and mounting systems. Some top-tier installers also provide production guarantees, ensuring your system will generate a minimum amount of electricity over time.</p>

<h3>Financing Options</h3>
<p>Solar companies in New Hampshire typically offer several financing options to make solar accessible to different budgets. Cash purchases provide the best long-term return on investment and qualify for all available tax incentives. Solar loans, including secured and unsecured options, allow homeowners to own their systems while spreading costs over time. Some installers partner with financing companies to offer attractive loan terms with little to no money down. Leases and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are less common in New Hampshire but may be available, though they typically provide lower long-term savings and may complicate future home sales.</p>

<h2>Red Flags to Avoid</h2>
<ul>
  <li>High-pressure sales tactics or demands to sign contracts immediately</li>
  <li>Prices that seem too good to be true or significantly below market rates</li>
  <li>No physical address or local presence in New Hampshire</li>
  <li>Unwillingness to provide references from recent New Hampshire customers</li>
  <li>Lack of proper licensing or reluctance to provide license numbers</li>
  <li>Door-to-door sales representatives making unrealistic savings claims</li>
  <li>Companies that require full payment upfront before work begins</li>
  <li>Installers who cannot explain the permitting and inspection process</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions to Ask Solar Companies</h2>
<p>Asking the right questions helps you evaluate potential solar installers and ensures you're making an informed decision. These questions will help you understand the company's experience, processes, and commitment to customer service, while also revealing important details about warranties, equipment, and long-term support.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How long have you been installing solar in New Hampshire, and how many installations have you completed?</li>
  <li>Can you provide references from New Hampshire customers with installations completed in the last two years?</li>
  <li>What warranties do you offer on equipment and workmanship, and what do they cover?</li>
  <li>Who handles the permitting process and utility interconnection applications?</li>
  <li>What happens if there's an issue with my system after installation, and how quickly do you respond to service calls?</li>
  <li>Are you licensed by the New Hampshire Electricians' Board, and do you have NABCEP certification?</li>
  <li>How do you ensure installations can handle New Hampshire's snow loads and weather conditions?</li>
  <li>What monitoring system do you provide, and how will I track my system's performance?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting and Comparing Quotes</h2>
<p>Obtaining multiple quotes is essential for making an informed decision about solar installation in New Hampshire. Aim to get at least three quotes from reputable installers to compare pricing, equipment options, and service offerings. When comparing quotes, look beyond the total price and examine the cost per watt, which provides a better basis for comparison. Consider the quality of proposed equipment, including panel efficiency ratings and inverter warranties. Compare warranty terms, financing options, and estimated timeline for completion. Also evaluate each company's communication style, responsiveness, and willingness to answer questions. The lowest price isn't always the best value if it comes with inferior equipment, shorter warranties, or poor customer service.</p>

<h2>New Hampshire-Specific Considerations</h2>
<p>New Hampshire's climate presents unique challenges and opportunities for solar installations. The state receives significant snowfall, so installers must design systems with adequate tilt angles to encourage snow shedding and use mounting systems rated for heavy snow loads. New Hampshire's net metering program allows customers to receive credit for excess electricity fed back to the grid, but policies vary by utility company. The state also participates in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which may influence future solar policies. Some homeowners associations in New Hampshire have restrictions on solar installations, so verify any covenant requirements before proceeding. Additionally, New Hampshire's property tax exemption for solar equipment means installations won't increase property tax assessments, making solar more attractive financially.</p>
