const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>New Hampshire presents an excellent opportunity for both solar panel installations and high-efficiency HVAC systems, making it an ideal state for homeowners looking to reduce their energy costs and environmental impact. With an average of 4.1 sun hours per day, the Granite State receives sufficient solar irradiance to make solar installations financially viable, despite its northern latitude. The state's relatively high electricity rates, averaging 19.6¢ per kilowatt-hour, create substantial savings potential for solar adopters compared to the national average of approximately 15¢/kWh.</p>

<p>Eversource Energy serves as the primary utility provider for much of New Hampshire, covering about 75% of the state's population, with other utilities including Liberty Utilities and New Hampshire Electric Cooperative serving smaller regions. These high electricity rates, combined with New Hampshire's net metering policies, create favorable economics for solar installations. The state's four-season climate, with cold winters requiring substantial heating and increasingly warm summers demanding cooling, makes efficient HVAC systems essential for maintaining comfort while controlling energy costs.</p>

<p>New Hampshire's commitment to renewable energy, evidenced by its Renewable Portfolio Standard requiring 25.2% renewable energy by 2025, along with various state and utility incentive programs, creates a supportive environment for solar and energy-efficient HVAC adoption. The combination of federal tax credits, state rebates, and utility programs can significantly offset the upfront costs of these systems, making them accessible to a broader range of homeowners while providing long-term energy savings and increased property values.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in New Hampshire</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>New Hampshire's solar resource potential is stronger than many residents realize, with the state ranking in the middle tier nationally for solar irradiance. The state receives approximately 1,400-1,500 kWh per square meter annually, with peak solar months occurring from May through August. Despite winter snow coverage that can temporarily reduce production, modern solar panels perform efficiently in cold temperatures, often producing more electricity per unit of sunlight in cooler conditions than in extreme heat.</p>

<p>A typical residential solar installation in New Hampshire can be expected to produce between 1,100-1,300 kWh annually per installed kilowatt, depending on factors such as roof orientation, tilt angle, shading, and local weather patterns. South-facing roofs with minimal shading provide optimal production, though east and west-facing installations can still achieve 80-90% of south-facing production. The state's net metering policy allows homeowners to receive full retail credit for excess solar production, making solar financially attractive even when production doesn't perfectly match consumption patterns.</p>

<p>Snow management is an important consideration for New Hampshire solar installations. While snow can temporarily reduce production, most residential solar panels are installed at sufficient angles (typically 30-45 degrees) to allow natural snow shedding. Modern solar panels also generate enough heat during sunny periods to melt light snow accumulation. Professional installers in New Hampshire are experienced with proper mounting systems and techniques to handle snow loads and ensure system safety throughout the winter months.</p>
