const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>New Hampshire presents an excellent opportunity for both solar panel installations and energy-efficient HVAC systems, making it an ideal state for homeowners looking to reduce their energy costs and carbon footprint. With an average of 4.1 peak sun hours per day, the Granite State receives sufficient solar irradiance to make solar installations highly productive and cost-effective. Despite common misconceptions about solar performance in northern climates, New Hampshire's cold, clear winter days actually enhance solar panel efficiency, while the state's moderate summer temperatures prevent the performance losses seen in extremely hot climates.</p>

<p>The economics for solar and HVAC upgrades in New Hampshire are particularly compelling due to the state's relatively high electricity rates, which average 19.6¢ per kilowatt-hour - significantly above the national average of approximately 16¢/kWh. Eversource, the state's primary utility provider serving over 500,000 customers, offers various programs and net metering policies that further enhance the financial benefits of solar installations. These high electricity rates mean that every kilowatt-hour of solar energy produced or HVAC efficiency gained translates to substantial savings on monthly utility bills.</p>

<p>New Hampshire's four-season climate, with cold winters requiring substantial heating and increasingly warm summers demanding cooling, creates year-round energy demands that make both solar panels and high-efficiency HVAC systems worthwhile investments. The state's commitment to renewable energy, combined with generous federal tax credits and state-specific incentives, creates a favorable environment for homeowners to make these energy-saving upgrades while significantly reducing their long-term energy costs.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in New Hampshire</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>New Hampshire's solar resource is more robust than many residents realize, with the state receiving between 3.5 to 4.5 peak sun hours daily depending on location and season. The southern regions of the state, including areas around Nashua, Manchester, and the Seacoast, typically see higher solar production due to their latitude and fewer topographical obstructions. Even northern regions like the White Mountains area maintain viable solar potential, with many installations exceeding expected production forecasts due to snow reflection and the improved efficiency of solar panels in cold temperatures.</p>

<p>A typical residential solar installation in New Hampshire can expect to produce between 1,100 to 1,300 kilowatt-hours per installed kilowatt annually. This means a 6kW system would generate approximately 6,600 to 7,800 kWh per year, which closely matches or exceeds the average New Hampshire household's annual electricity consumption of about 6,200 kWh. The state's net metering policies allow homeowners to receive full retail rate credit for excess solar production, making oversized systems economically beneficial for offsetting seasonal variations in solar production.</p>

<p>Seasonal variation is an important consideration for New Hampshire solar installations. Summer months (June through August) typically produce 40-45% of annual solar generation, while winter months (December through February) account for only 15-20% of annual production. However, this seasonal pattern aligns reasonably well with typical household energy usage patterns, where air conditioning loads in summer are offset by higher heating demands in winter. Ground-mounted systems, while more expensive initially, can be particularly effective in New Hampshire as they can be positioned for optimal snow shedding and year-round solar access.</p>

<p>The payback period for solar installations in New Hampshire typically ranges from 8 to 12 years, depending on system size, energy usage patterns, and available incentives. With solar panel warranties of 25 years and expected system lifespans of 30+ years, homeowners can expect 15-20 years of free electricity production after the system pays for itself. The strong net metering policies in New Hampshire, which provide full retail rate credit for excess production, significantly improve the economics compared to states with less favorable policies.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems in New Hampshire</h2>

<h3>Climate Considerations</h3>
<p>New Hampshire's continental climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, with heating degree days ranging from 6,000 to 8,000 annually depending on location, and cooling degree days typically between 400 to 800. This means heating represents the dominant HVAC load, often accounting for 60-70% of total annual energy consumption in typical homes. Winter temperatures regularly drop below 0°F in many areas, requiring heating systems capable of maintaining comfort during extended cold periods while operating efficiently across a wide temperature range.</p>

<p>The increasing frequency of summer temperatures above 85°F has made air conditioning more of a necessity rather than a luxury in New Hampshire. However, the relatively short cooling season means that cooling equipment often operates at part-load conditions, making variable-capacity systems particularly attractive for their ability to maintain comfort while minimizing energy consumption during moderate weather conditions.</p>

<p>Humidity control is another important consideration, particularly during New Hampshire's humid summers. High-efficiency HVAC systems with variable-speed components excel at moisture removal during part-load conditions, improving both comfort and indoor air quality. In winter, proper humidity control helps prevent issues with dry air while maintaining energy efficiency. Heat pump systems have become increasingly popular in New Hampshire, with modern cold-climate heat pumps capable of providing efficient heating even at temperatures well below 0°F.</p>

<p>Heat pump technology has advanced significantly in recent years, with cold-climate heat pumps now capable of operating efficiently at temperatures as low as -15°F. These systems can provide heating at costs 40-60% lower than traditional electric resistance heating and 20-30% lower than oil heating, which is still common in New Hampshire. For homes currently heated with oil, propane, or electric resistance, the potential savings from upgrading to a high-efficiency heat pump system can be substantial, often exceeding \$1,000 annually.</p>

<h2>New Hampshire Incentives & Rebates</h2>

<p>New Hampshire offers a comprehensive suite of incentives that significantly improve the economics of both solar panel installations and high-efficiency HVAC systems. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) remains the most significant incentive, allowing homeowners to deduct 30% of their total solar installation costs from their federal taxes through 2032. This credit applies to the full system cost, including equipment, installation, and associated electrical work, and can be carried forward if it exceeds tax liability in the installation year.</p>

<p>The state of New Hampshire provides additional support through its Renewable Energy Rebate Program, offering rebates up to \$3,500 for residential solar installations. This program, administered by the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, provides \$0.75 per watt for systems up to 5kW, with additional incentives available for systems that include battery storage. The program also offers enhanced rebates for moderate-income households, making solar more accessible across different economic levels.</p>

<p>Eversource, New Hampshire's largest utility provider, operates the Energy Star Homes Program and offers rebates for high-efficiency HVAC equipment. These rebates include up to \$1,200 for ENERGY STAR certified air source heat pumps, up to \$5,000 for geothermal heat pump systems, and up to \$400 for high-efficiency central air conditioning systems. The utility also provides financing options through its on-bill recovery program, allowing customers to pay for efficiency upgrades through their monthly utility bills with terms up to 12 years.</p>

<p>Additional local incentives may be available through municipal programs and the New Hampshire Saves program, which offers low-interest financing for energy efficiency improvements. Property tax exemptions for solar installations ensure that adding solar panels won't increase property tax assessments, while net metering policies guarantee full retail rate credit for excess solar production. These combined incentives can reduce the effective cost of solar installations by 40-50% and HVAC upgrades by 20-30%.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="space-y-6 my-6">
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">How much do solar panels cost in New Hampshire?</h3>
    <p>Solar panel costs in New Hampshire typically range from \$2.75 to \$3.25 per watt before incentives, making a typical 7kW residential system cost between \$19,250 and \$22,750 before applying the federal tax credit. After the 30% federal tax credit and state rebates, homeowners can expect to pay between \$12,000 and \$16,000 for a complete installation. The exact cost depends on factors including roof complexity, equipment selection, local permitting requirements, and installer pricing. Higher-end systems with premium panels and optimizers may cost slightly more but often provide better long-term value through increased production and longer warranties.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">What SEER rating is recommended for New Hampshire?</h3>
    <p>For New Hampshire's climate, SEER ratings of 16-18 typically provide the best balance of efficiency and cost-effectiveness for central air conditioning systems. While higher SEER ratings (20+) are available, the relatively short cooling season in most of New Hampshire means the additional cost may not be justified by energy savings alone. However, for heat pump systems that provide both heating and cooling, higher efficiency ratings (SEER 18+ and HSPF 9.5+) are often worthwhile due to their year-round operation. The key is to consider both SEER for cooling efficiency and HSPF (Heating Seasonal Performance Factor) for heating efficiency when selecting heat pump systems.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Do solar panels work effectively in New Hampshire winters?</h3>
    <p>Yes, solar panels work effectively in New Hampshire winters, often performing better than expected due to several factors. Cold temperatures actually improve solar panel efficiency, as photovoltaic cells operate more efficiently in cooler conditions. Snow reflection can boost solar production on clear winter days, and New Hampshire receives substantial winter sunshine despite shorter day lengths. While winter production is typically 60-70% lower than summer peaks, annual production still meets expectations. Modern panels are designed to shed snow naturally, and the steep angle of winter sun helps with snow removal. Most systems produce 85-95% of their projected annual output despite winter weather conditions.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">How long do HVAC systems typically last in New Hampshire?</h3>
    <p>HVAC system lifespan in New Hampshire varies by equipment type and maintenance quality.
