const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>New Hampshire presents exceptional opportunities for both solar panel installations and energy-efficient HVAC systems, making it an ideal state for homeowners looking to reduce energy costs and environmental impact. With an average of 4.1 sun hours per day, the Granite State receives sufficient solar irradiance throughout the year to make solar installations highly profitable. The state's electricity rates averaging 19.6¢ per kWh—significantly higher than the national average—create compelling economics for solar adoption, allowing homeowners to achieve substantial savings on their monthly utility bills.</p>

<p>Eversource Energy serves as the primary utility provider for most of New Hampshire, offering net metering programs that allow solar customers to sell excess electricity back to the grid at retail rates. The state's four-season climate, characterized by cold winters and warm summers, creates year-round energy demands that make both solar panels and high-efficiency HVAC systems essential investments. New Hampshire's commitment to renewable energy, combined with favorable state and federal incentives, positions homeowners to achieve payback periods of 8-12 years on solar installations while enjoying decades of free electricity thereafter.</p>

<p>The combination of New Hampshire's solar resource potential and high electricity costs creates an environment where integrated solar and HVAC solutions can deliver exceptional value. Modern heat pump systems powered by solar electricity offer particular advantages in New Hampshire's climate, providing efficient heating in winter and cooling in summer while maximizing the value of solar production throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in New Hampshire</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>New Hampshire receives approximately 1,500 kWh of solar irradiance per square meter annually, with peak production occurring during the summer months from June through August. The state's solar resource is remarkably consistent, with even winter months providing viable solar production despite shorter daylight hours and occasional snow coverage. A typical residential solar installation in New Hampshire can expect to generate between 1,200-1,400 kWh per installed kW annually, making it one of the more productive northeastern states for solar energy.</p>

<p>Seasonal variations in New Hampshire solar production follow predictable patterns, with summer months producing 40-50% more electricity than winter months. However, the state's cold temperatures actually improve solar panel efficiency, as photovoltaic cells operate more effectively in cooler conditions. Snow coverage, while temporary, typically slides off modern solar panels or melts quickly due to the dark surface absorption, minimizing long-term production impacts.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems in New Hampshire</h2>

<h3>Climate Considerations</h3>
<p>New Hampshire's continental climate requires HVAC systems capable of handling temperature extremes ranging from below 0°F in winter to over 85°F in summer. The state experiences approximately 7,300 heating degree days and 500 cooling degree days annually, indicating that heating represents the primary HVAC load. For cooling applications, SEER ratings of 16-20 are recommended to maximize efficiency during the summer months, while heating systems should prioritize cold-weather performance and efficiency.</p>

<p>Heat pump systems are increasingly popular in New Hampshire, particularly cold-climate air source heat pumps rated for operation down to -15°F or below. These systems can provide both heating and cooling while maintaining high efficiency throughout New Hampshire's temperature range. Traditional heating systems like natural gas furnaces or oil boilers remain common, but modern heat pump technology offers superior efficiency and the ability to integrate seamlessly with solar panel systems.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="space-y-6 my-6">
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">How much do solar panels cost in New Hampshire?</h3>
    <p>Solar panel costs in New Hampshire typically range from \$2.80 to \$3.50 per watt installed, meaning a typical 8kW residential system costs between \$22,400 and \$28,000 before incentives. After applying the 30% federal tax credit and potential state rebates, homeowners can expect to pay \$15,680 to \$19,600 for a complete solar installation. These costs include all equipment (panels, inverters, mounting systems), installation labor, permitting, and interconnection fees. Financing options are widely available, including solar loans with rates as low as 3.99% APR, allowing many homeowners to achieve immediate monthly savings even with loan payments.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">What SEER rating is recommended for New Hampshire?</h3>
    <p>For New Hampshire's climate, SEER ratings of 16-20 are recommended for central air conditioning systems, providing optimal efficiency during the state's moderate cooling season. Since New Hampshire has relatively low cooling demands compared to heating needs, investing in extremely high SEER ratings (above 20) may not provide sufficient payback through energy savings. For heat pump systems providing both heating and cooling, look for units with SEER ratings of 18+ and HSPF (Heating Seasonal Performance Factor) ratings of 9.0 or higher to ensure efficient operation during New Hampshire's extended heating season. Cold-climate heat pumps rated for operation at -15°F or below are specifically recommended for reliable winter performance.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Do solar panels work during New Hampshire winters?</h3>
    <p>Yes, solar panels work effectively during New Hampshire winters, often performing better than expected due to increased efficiency in cold temperatures. While snow can temporarily reduce production, modern panels are installed at angles that promote natural snow shedding, and their dark surfaces help accelerate melting. Even on cloudy winter days, panels continue generating electricity from available daylight. Annual solar production calculations already account for seasonal variations, and properly designed systems still achieve their projected energy output despite winter weather conditions.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">What size solar system do I need for my New Hampshire home?</h3>
    <p>Most New Hampshire homes require 6kW to 12kW solar systems to offset their electricity usage, depending on home size, efficiency, and energy consumption patterns. A typical 2,000 square foot home with electric heat might need an`;
