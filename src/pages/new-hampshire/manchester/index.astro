const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Manchester, New Hampshire</h2>
<p>Manchester, New Hampshire presents an excellent opportunity for homeowners to invest in solar panels and efficient HVAC systems. With electricity rates at 19.9¢/kWh through Eversource—significantly higher than the national average—residents can achieve substantial savings by generating their own clean energy. The cold climate in Hillsborough County means heating costs are a major concern for Manchester's 115,644 residents, making energy-efficient solutions not just environmentally responsible but financially essential.</p>

<p>Despite New Hampshire's reputation for harsh winters, Manchester receives adequate sunlight for solar production, with panels performing efficiently even in cold temperatures. The combination of high electricity rates, net metering policies, and federal incentives creates a compelling case for solar adoption. Additionally, the cold climate necessitates reliable, efficient HVAC systems that can handle temperature swings from below freezing in winter to warm summer days, making proper system selection crucial for comfort and energy savings in typical 1,720 square foot Manchester homes.</p>

<p>Solar installation costs in Manchester typically range from \$3.00 to \$3.50 per watt before incentives. With Eversource's high electricity rates at 19.9¢/kWh, most homeowners see payback periods of 8-10 years. A 6kW system is ideal for the average 1,720 square foot Manchester home, producing approximately 7,200 kWh annually and offsetting a significant portion of electricity costs. These calculations assume Manchester's average of 4.2 peak sun hours daily and account for seasonal variations in solar production.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Manchester</h2>
<p>Manchester's cold climate demands robust HVAC systems capable of handling winter temperatures that frequently drop below 20°F while maintaining efficiency during moderate summer cooling needs. For heating, high-efficiency gas furnaces with AFUE ratings of 90% or higher are most common and cost-effective, though cold-climate heat pumps are gaining popularity as backup heating becomes more reliable. Air conditioning systems should have SEER ratings of at least 16, though 18+ SEER units provide better long-term savings given Eversource's high electricity rates.</p>

<p>Heat pump systems designed for cold climates, such as those from Mitsubishi, Daikin, or Carrier, can operate effectively down to -15°F and provide both heating and cooling. These systems work exceptionally well when paired with solar panels, as they can significantly reduce heating costs compared to traditional electric resistance heating. For Manchester homes, ductless mini-split systems offer excellent zoning capabilities, allowing residents to heat only occupied spaces during cold months, while central ducted systems provide whole-home comfort and better air filtration.</p>

<h2>Manchester Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Manchester residents benefit from several attractive incentives for solar and HVAC installations. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on total solar system costs through 2032, then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. New Hampshire doesn't impose sales tax on solar installations and offers property tax exemptions for solar equipment, meaning the added home value from solar won't increase property taxes.</p>

<p>Eversource participates in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and offers rebates for energy-efficient HVAC equipment through their Home Energy Solutions program. Heat pump rebates can reach \$1,200 for qualifying systems, while high-efficiency furnaces and central air conditioning units may qualify for rebates up to \$500. The New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission's net metering program allows solar customers to receive full retail credit for excess electricity sent to the grid, maximizing savings potential for Manchester homeowners with properly sized solar systems.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Manchester</h2>
<p>Manchester's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. The West Side, featuring many historic homes with mature tree coverage, may require careful solar panel placement to avoid shading while older homes might need electrical upgrades and improved insulation before HVAC system replacements. The North End's mix of newer construction and renovated properties typically offers excellent solar potential with south-facing roof orientations and modern electrical systems.</p>

<p>East Manchester neighborhoods, including areas near Lake Massabesic, often feature larger lots with less shading, making them ideal for ground-mounted solar systems when roof installations aren't optimal. The Pinardville area's ranch-style homes from the 1960s-80s frequently benefit from ductless mini-split systems, which can provide better comfort and efficiency than upgrading old ductwork. Downtown Manchester's urban environment may present installation challenges but often features newer construction with modern electrical systems suitable for solar integration.</p>

<h2>Choosing Solar and HVAC Contractors in Manchester</h2>
<p>Selecting qualified contractors is crucial for successful solar and HVAC installations in Manchester. Look for solar installers certified by NABCEP (North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners) with specific experience in New Hampshire's climate and permitting requirements. Local installers familiar with Manchester's building codes and Eversource's interconnection process can streamline installations and ensure proper system commissioning.</p>

<p>For HVAC contractors, seek businesses licensed by the New Hampshire Board of Home Improvement Contractors with EPA certifications for refrigerant handling. Contractors should provide detailed load calculations for your specific Manchester home, considering factors like insulation levels, window efficiency, and local climate data. Request multiple quotes and verify that proposed systems meet New Hampshire energy codes and qualify for available rebates. The best contractors will coordinate solar and HVAC installations to optimize system performance and maximize energy savings.</p>
