const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Columbia, Missouri</h2>
<p>Columbia, Missouri presents an excellent opportunity for homeowners to invest in solar panels and efficient HVAC systems. With a population of 126,254 in Boone County, Columbia experiences a Cold-Mixed climate that creates significant heating and cooling demands throughout the year. The city's electricity rate of 11.3¢/kWh, provided by Columbia Water & Light, is relatively moderate compared to national averages, making solar installations financially attractive with typical payback periods of 8-12 years.</p>

<p>The Cold-Mixed climate in Columbia means residents face hot, humid summers requiring substantial air conditioning, followed by cold winters demanding efficient heating systems. This seasonal variation creates ideal conditions for solar energy production during peak summer months when electricity usage is highest. Columbia Water & Light's net metering program allows homeowners to sell excess solar energy back to the grid, maximizing the financial benefits of solar installations while reducing strain on the local electrical infrastructure during peak demand periods.</p>

<p>For Columbia's average home size of 1,780 square feet, a 6-7kW solar system typically provides optimal coverage for annual electricity needs. The annual savings calculations are based on Columbia's 11.3¢/kWh rate and average solar production of approximately 1,200-1,300 kWh per kW installed annually, accounting for Missouri's solar irradiance levels and seasonal variations.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Columbia</h2>
<p>Columbia's Cold-Mixed climate requires HVAC systems capable of handling temperature extremes ranging from sub-zero winter conditions to summer highs in the 90s with high humidity. For optimal efficiency and comfort, homeowners should consider high-efficiency heat pumps with SEER ratings of 16-20 and HSPF ratings of 9-10. Dual-fuel systems combining heat pumps with gas furnace backup are particularly effective in Columbia, automatically switching to gas heating when temperatures drop below 30°F for maximum efficiency.</p>

<p>Given Columbia's humidity levels, proper dehumidification is crucial during summer months. Variable-speed air handlers and two-stage cooling systems provide better humidity control while maintaining consistent temperatures throughout the home. For the average 1,780 square foot home in Columbia, a 3-ton system typically provides adequate capacity, though proper load calculations should always be performed to account for insulation levels, window efficiency, and home orientation.</p>

<h3>Recommended HVAC Features for Columbia:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Heat pumps with cold-weather performance packages for sub-freezing operation</li>
<li>Variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems for larger homes requiring zoned comfort</li>
<li>Smart thermostats with humidity control and seasonal programming</li>
<li>High-efficiency air filtration systems to handle seasonal allergens</li>
<li>Ductless mini-split systems for additions or rooms with unique heating/cooling needs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Columbia Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Columbia residents have access to several attractive incentives for solar and HVAC installations. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on the total cost of solar installations through 2032, stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to all system components, including panels, inverters, mounting equipment, and installation labor, representing significant savings for Columbia homeowners.</p>

<p>Missouri offers additional state-level incentives, including property tax exemptions for renewable energy systems, ensuring that solar installations don't increase property tax assessments. Columbia Water & Light participates in various efficiency programs, offering rebates for high-efficiency HVAC equipment, smart thermostats, and energy-efficient appliances. The utility also provides free energy audits to help homeowners identify the most cost-effective efficiency improvements before investing in solar or HVAC upgrades.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Columbia</h2>
<p>Columbia's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. The historic downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods like Benton-Stephens often feature older homes requiring HVAC system upgrades and careful solar panel placement to accommodate mature tree coverage. These areas benefit from ductless mini-split systems for homes without existing ductwork and creative solar mounting solutions for complex rooflines.</p>

<p>Newer developments in areas like Rock Bridge and southeastern Columbia typically feature more modern electrical systems and optimal roof orientations for solar installations. These neighborhoods often have larger lot sizes with fewer shading issues, making them ideal for ground-mounted solar arrays when roof space is limited. The Southwest Columbia area, with its mix of established and developing neighborhoods, offers excellent opportunities for comprehensive solar and HVAC upgrades in homes built in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Columbia</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in Columbia?</h3><p>Solar panel installations in Columbia typically cost \$2.50-\$3.00 per watt before incentives, meaning a 6kW system runs \$15,000-\$18,000 before the 30% federal tax credit. After incentives, homeowners can expect to pay \$10,500-\$12,600 for a system sized for the average 1,780 square foot Columbia home. With Columbia's 11.3¢/kWh electricity rate, most systems pay for themselves within 10-13 years.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Best HVAC for Columbia climate?</h3><p>For Columbia's Cold-Mixed climate, dual-fuel heat pump systems with 16+ SEER cooling and 9+ HSPF heating ratings provide optimal year-round efficiency. These systems use efficient heat pump operation during mild weather and automatically switch to backup heating during extreme cold snaps. Variable-speed systems offer superior humidity control during Columbia's humid summers while maintaining consistent comfort levels.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does Columbia Water offer solar rebates?</h3><p>Columbia Water & Light doesn't currently offer direct solar rebates, but they do provide net metering that credits customers for excess solar energy fed back into the grid at the retail rate of 11.3¢/kWh. They offer various efficiency rebates for HVAC equipment, water heaters, and other appliances that pair well with solar installations to maximize overall energy savings.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">What size solar system do I need in Columbia?</h3><p>The average Columbia home requires a 6-7kW solar system to offset annual electricity usage. This accounts for the typical 1,780 square foot home size and Missouri's solar production of approximately 1,250 kWh per kW installed annually. Homes with electric heating, pools, or electric vehicles may require 8-10kW systems for complete energy offset.</p></div>
