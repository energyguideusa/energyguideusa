const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in St Louis</h2>
<p>St. Louis homeowners face unique HVAC challenges due to the city's Cold-Mixed climate, which brings hot, humid summers and cold winters. With temperatures ranging from below freezing in winter to above 90°F in summer, your HVAC system must efficiently handle both heating and cooling demands throughout the year. The region's high humidity levels during summer months can make temperatures feel even hotter, requiring robust cooling systems that can effectively manage moisture control alongside temperature regulation.</p>

<p>Energy costs are a significant consideration for St. Louis's 301,578 residents, with Ameren Missouri providing electricity at an average rate of 11.6¢/kWh. This relatively moderate rate makes high-efficiency HVAC systems a smart investment, as the energy savings from upgrading to a more efficient system can result in substantial cost reductions over time. With the Cold-Mixed climate requiring year-round HVAC operation, choosing the right system efficiency rating can mean the difference between manageable and overwhelming utility bills.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for St Louis Climate</h2>
<p>For St. Louis's Cold-Mixed climate, a minimum 16 SEER air conditioning system is recommended, though 18-20 SEER units provide optimal efficiency for the region's demanding summers. Heat pumps are particularly well-suited for St. Louis, as they can efficiently handle both heating and cooling needs when temperatures don't drop below 25°F for extended periods. For backup heating during extreme cold snaps, a dual-fuel system combining a heat pump with a gas furnace offers the best of both worlds. Variable-speed systems are especially beneficial in St. Louis County due to their ability to handle the region's fluctuating temperatures and humidity levels while maintaining consistent comfort. Consider systems with enhanced dehumidification features, as Missouri's humidity can make summers feel oppressive even at moderate temperatures.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in St Louis</h2>
<p>St. Louis residents have access to multiple rebate programs that can significantly reduce HVAC installation costs. Federal tax credits offer up to \$2,000 for qualifying heat pumps and up to \$600 for high-efficiency air conditioners installed through 2032. Ameren Missouri provides substantial rebates for energy-efficient upgrades, including up to \$400 for ENERGY STAR certified central air conditioners, \$600 for heat pumps, and additional incentives for smart thermostats. Missouri's state energy office occasionally offers supplemental rebate programs, particularly for low-income households. The city of St. Louis has historically provided additional incentives through its sustainability initiatives. Combining federal, utility, and local rebates can reduce your total HVAC investment by \$1,000-3,000, making high-efficiency systems much more affordable for homeowners.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in St Louis</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in St. Louis requires careful consideration of several key factors. Ensure your contractor holds proper Missouri state licensing and NATE (North American Technician Excellence) certification, which demonstrates technical competency. Look for contractors with extensive experience in Cold-Mixed climates who understand the specific challenges of St. Louis weather patterns. Verify they're insured and bonded, and check their Better Business Bureau rating along with recent customer reviews. Quality contractors should provide detailed written estimates, offer comprehensive warranties on both equipment and labor, and be available for emergency repairs during extreme weather events. Ask about their experience with Ameren rebate programs and their ability to help you navigate the application process. Local contractors familiar with St. Louis County building codes and permit requirements can ensure smooth installations that meet all regulatory standards.</p>
