const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in St Louis</h2>
<p>St. Louis homeowners face unique HVAC challenges due to the city's Cold-Mixed climate, which brings hot, humid summers and cold winters to the region's 301,578 residents. This climate demands versatile heating and cooling systems that can handle temperature swings from below freezing in January to over 90°F in July, with high humidity levels throughout the summer months. The city's location along the Mississippi River creates additional moisture concerns that HVAC systems must address through proper dehumidification and air circulation.</p>

<p>Energy costs play a significant role in HVAC system selection for St. Louis homeowners, with Ameren Missouri providing electricity at an average rate of 11.6¢/kWh. While this rate is below the national average, the extreme seasonal demands of the Cold-Mixed climate mean HVAC systems run extensively for both heating and cooling, making energy efficiency a critical factor in system selection. High-efficiency systems can reduce monthly utility bills by \$50-150 during peak usage months, making the initial investment in quality equipment worthwhile for long-term savings.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for St Louis Climate</h2>
<p>For St. Louis's Cold-Mixed climate, heat pump systems with backup heating provide optimal year-round efficiency, particularly models rated 16 SEER or higher for cooling and 8.5 HSPF for heating. During mild winter days (above 35°F), heat pumps operate at 300% efficiency, making them cost-effective with Ameren's 11.6¢/kWh rates. For homes without natural gas access, dual-fuel systems combining heat pumps with electric resistance backup work well, though gas furnaces paired with high-efficiency air conditioners remain popular due to St. Louis's established natural gas infrastructure. Variable-speed systems are particularly beneficial for managing humidity during St. Louis's muggy summers, providing better comfort control while reducing energy consumption by 20-30% compared to single-speed units.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in St Louis</h2>
<p>St. Louis homeowners can access multiple rebate programs to offset HVAC installation costs. Federal tax credits offer 30% back on qualifying heat pump installations through 2032, with a maximum credit of \$2,000 per unit. Ameren Missouri provides substantial rebates through their energy efficiency programs, including \$250-500 for ENERGY STAR certified central air conditioners, \$300-800 for qualifying heat pumps, and \$50-200 for smart thermostats. Missouri also offers state tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements, though these vary by year and income level. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act provides point-of-sale rebates for qualifying households, potentially covering 50-100% of heat pump costs for eligible residents based on income thresholds, making high-efficiency systems more accessible to St. Louis County homeowners.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in St Louis</h2>
<p>Selecting a reliable HVAC contractor in St. Louis requires verifying proper Missouri licensing and EPA Section 608 certification for refrigerant handling. Look for contractors with extensive experience in Cold-Mixed climate installations who understand local humidity challenges and can properly size systems for St. Louis's temperature extremes. Quality contractors should provide detailed load calculations, offer multiple system options, and explain how different efficiency ratings will impact your Ameren utility bills. Verify insurance coverage, check Better Business Bureau ratings, and request references from recent installations in the St. Louis area. Emergency service availability is crucial given the city's harsh winters and hot summers, so choose contractors offering 24/7 repair services with reasonable response times for system failures during extreme weather events.</p>
