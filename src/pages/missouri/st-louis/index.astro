const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in St Louis, Missouri</h2>
<p>St. Louis, Missouri presents excellent opportunities for homeowners to invest in solar panels and efficient HVAC systems. With a population of 301,578 residents and an average home size of 1,720 square feet, the city's Cold-Mixed climate creates distinct seasonal energy demands that make solar and HVAC upgrades particularly valuable. The region experiences hot, humid summers and cold winters, leading to significant heating and cooling costs that can be substantially reduced through strategic energy improvements.</p>

<p>Ameren Missouri serves as the primary utility provider for St. Louis residents, with electricity rates at 11.6¢ per kWh. While this rate is relatively moderate compared to coastal markets, the substantial energy usage required for heating and cooling in St. Louis's variable climate means homeowners can still achieve meaningful savings through solar installations and high-efficiency HVAC systems. The city's position in the Midwest provides adequate solar irradiance for effective solar panel performance, while the temperature extremes make HVAC efficiency improvements essential for long-term energy cost management.</p>

<p>Solar panel installations in St. Louis typically range from \$2.50 to \$3.50 per watt before incentives, with most residential systems falling between 5kW and 10kW to accommodate the average 1,720 square foot homes. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of 30% significantly reduces upfront costs, making solar more accessible for St. Louis homeowners. With Ameren's net metering program, excess solar production can be credited back to your account, though the credit rate is typically lower than the retail electricity rate of 11.6¢/kWh.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for St Louis</h2>
<p>St. Louis's Cold-Mixed climate zone requires HVAC systems capable of handling both summer temperatures reaching the 90s with high humidity and winter lows often dropping below freezing. For this climate, high-efficiency heat pumps with SEER ratings of 16-20 and HSPF ratings of 9-10 are ideal, providing both heating and cooling efficiently. Gas furnaces paired with central air conditioning units are also popular, with AFUE ratings of 90% or higher recommended for the heating component and SEER ratings of at least 16 for cooling.</p>

<p>Given St. Louis's humidity levels, proper dehumidification capabilities are essential, making variable-speed systems particularly valuable. These systems can run longer at lower speeds, providing better humidity control while maintaining consistent temperatures. For the 1,720 square foot average home size in St. Louis, a 2.5 to 3-ton system typically provides adequate capacity, though proper load calculations should always be performed to account for insulation levels, window efficiency, and home orientation.</p>

<h2>St Louis Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>St. Louis residents have access to several valuable incentives for solar and HVAC improvements. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit allows homeowners to deduct 30% of solar installation costs from their federal taxes through 2032, with the credit stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Missouri does not impose sales tax on solar equipment, providing additional savings of approximately 4-8% depending on local tax rates.</p>

<p>Ameren Missouri offers rebates for high-efficiency HVAC equipment through their energy efficiency programs. Heat pump installations can qualify for rebates up to \$850, while high-efficiency central air conditioning systems may receive rebates up to \$650. Additional rebates are available for programmable thermostats, duct sealing, and insulation improvements. The utility also provides free energy audits for customers, helping identify the most cost-effective efficiency improvements for St. Louis homes.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in St Louis</h2>
<p>St. Louis's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. The Central West End and Clayton areas feature many historic homes with mature tree coverage, requiring careful solar site assessment and potentially specialized HVAC solutions for older building layouts. These upscale neighborhoods often have higher property values that can better accommodate premium solar and HVAC investments.</p>

<p>South St. Louis neighborhoods like Tower Grove and Benton Park consist largely of brick homes built in the early 1900s, which may require HVAC system modifications to work with existing ductwork or the addition of ductless mini-split systems. The Delmar Loop and University City areas attract environmentally conscious residents who are often early adopters of solar technology. North County areas like Florissant and Hazelwood typically feature newer construction with more standard roof orientations suitable for solar installations and modern HVAC infrastructure.</p>

<h2>FAQs for St Louis</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
