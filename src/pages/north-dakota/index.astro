const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>North Dakota presents exceptional opportunities for both solar energy and HVAC system optimization, making it an increasingly attractive state for homeowners seeking energy independence and efficiency. With an average of 4.5 sun hours per day and some of the most consistent solar irradiance in the northern United States, North Dakota's solar potential rivals many southern states. The state's relatively low electricity rates at 10.2¢ per kWh, primarily served by Xcel Energy and other regional utilities, create a stable foundation for calculating solar savings and return on investment.</p>

<p>The state's continental climate presents unique HVAC challenges and opportunities, with extreme temperature variations ranging from summer highs in the 80s to winter lows well below zero. This climate demands robust, efficient heating systems while still requiring adequate cooling capacity. North Dakota homeowners typically see heating costs dominate their energy bills, making high-efficiency heat pumps, geothermal systems, and properly sized conventional HVAC equipment critical for managing energy expenses.</p>

<p>The combination of abundant solar resources, stable utility infrastructure, and significant heating demands creates substantial energy savings potential for North Dakota residents. Solar installations can offset 80-100% of annual electricity usage, while modern HVAC upgrades can reduce heating and cooling costs by 20-40%. State and federal incentives, including the 30% federal solar tax credit and North Dakota's renewable energy tax credit, further enhance the financial benefits of these energy investments.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in North Dakota</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>North Dakota's solar irradiance levels average 4.2-4.8 kWh/m²/day annually, with peak production occurring during the long summer days when the state receives up to 16 hours of daylight. The state's northern latitude provides extended daylight hours during peak solar season, compensating for the lower winter sun angles. Most areas of North Dakota fall within solar irradiance zones 3-4, making solar installations highly productive.</p>

<p>Seasonal variations are significant, with summer months producing 2-3 times more solar energy than winter months. However, North Dakota's cold, clear winter days often provide excellent solar production conditions, as solar panels operate more efficiently in cooler temperatures. Snow can temporarily reduce production but typically slides off tilted panels quickly due to the state's frequent winds and temperature fluctuations.</p>

<p>A typical 6kW residential solar system in North Dakota produces approximately 7,200-8,400 kWh annually, easily offsetting the average household's electricity consumption of 12,000-15,000 kWh when combined with energy efficiency measures. The state's net metering policies allow excess production to be credited at retail rates, maximizing the value of solar generation during peak production periods.</p>
