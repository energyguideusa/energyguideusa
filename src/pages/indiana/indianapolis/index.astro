const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Indianapolis, Indiana</h2>
<p>Indianapolis presents excellent opportunities for homeowners looking to invest in solar panels and efficient HVAC systems. With a population of 887,642 in Marion County, the city's Cold-Mixed climate creates significant energy demands throughout the year, making energy efficiency improvements particularly valuable. Indianapolis Power & Light (IPL) customers currently pay 12.3¢ per kWh, which is slightly above the national average, creating substantial potential for savings through solar energy production and efficient heating and cooling systems.</p>

<p>The Cold-Mixed climate zone means Indianapolis experiences hot, humid summers requiring substantial air conditioning and cold winters demanding reliable heating systems. This seasonal variation makes solar panels especially attractive, as they can offset high summer cooling costs while still producing meaningful energy during winter months. Combined with modern HVAC systems designed for this climate zone, Indianapolis homeowners can achieve significant reductions in their energy bills while improving home comfort year-round.</p>

<p>Solar panel installation costs in Indianapolis typically range from \$3.00 to \$3.50 per watt before incentives. For the average Indianapolis home size of 1,920 square feet, a 6-8kW system usually provides optimal energy production. With IPL's net metering program, excess solar energy feeds back into the grid, earning credits at the retail electricity rate of 12.3¢ per kWh. Most Indianapolis solar installations pay for themselves within 12-15 years, with systems lasting 25+ years under warranty.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Indianapolis</h2>
<p>Indianapolis's Cold-Mixed climate demands HVAC systems capable of handling temperature extremes from below 0°F in winter to over 90°F in summer with high humidity. For air conditioning, systems with SEER ratings of 16-20 provide optimal efficiency for the hot, humid summers typical in central Indiana. Heat pumps work well in this climate zone, providing both heating and cooling, though backup heating may be necessary during the coldest winter days when temperatures drop below 25°F.</p>

<p>For traditional split systems, gas furnaces with AFUE ratings of 90% or higher paired with high-efficiency air conditioners offer reliable performance. Variable-speed systems provide enhanced comfort and efficiency by adjusting output to match heating and cooling demands. Proper sizing is crucial for Indianapolis homes - oversized systems cycle frequently and fail to adequately dehumidify during summer months, while undersized systems struggle during peak heating and cooling seasons. Professional load calculations should account for the average 1,920 square foot home size and local climate conditions.</p>

<h2>Indianapolis Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Indianapolis residents benefit from several attractive incentives for solar and HVAC upgrades. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit for solar installations through 2032, then decreases to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the full system cost including equipment, installation, and permitting fees. Indiana offers additional property tax exemptions for renewable energy systems, meaning solar panels won't increase property tax assessments despite adding home value.</p>

<p>IPL participates in various energy efficiency rebate programs for HVAC upgrades. High-efficiency air conditioners and heat pumps can qualify for rebates up to \$600, while smart thermostats earn rebates of \$50-100. The utility also offers time-of-use rates that can benefit solar customers, allowing them to sell excess daytime solar production at higher rates while using grid power during lower-rate evening hours. Indiana's Renewable Energy Property Tax Deduction further reduces the financial burden of solar investments by exempting the added property value from taxation.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Indianapolis</h2>
<p>Indianapolis's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. In historic areas like Meridian-Kessler and Butler-Tarkington, older homes often feature mature tree canopy that may limit solar potential but provides natural cooling benefits. These neighborhoods typically have larger homes with aging HVAC systems that benefit significantly from modern, efficient replacements. The established infrastructure supports proper electrical upgrades needed for solar installations.</p>

<p>Suburban neighborhoods like Geist and Carmel (technically outside Indianapolis but served by similar utilities) feature newer construction with better insulation and modern electrical systems, making them ideal for both solar panels and high-efficiency HVAC systems. These areas often have optimal roof orientations and minimal shading. Downtown neighborhoods including Mass Ave and Fountain Square present unique challenges with row houses and limited roof space, making community solar programs or innovative mounting solutions attractive alternatives. Westside neighborhoods like Speedway offer excellent solar potential with many ranch-style homes featuring south-facing roofs ideal for panel installation.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Indianapolis</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in Indianapolis?</h3><p>Solar panels in Indianapolis typically cost \$15,000-30,000 before incentives, or \$10,500-21,000 after the 30% federal tax credit.

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Best HVAC for Indianapolis climate?</h3><p>Indianapolis's Cold-Mixed climate works best with high-efficiency heat pumps (16+ SEER, 9+ HSPF) for moderate weather, backed up by gas furnaces (90%+ AFUE) for extreme cold. Variable-speed systems provide optimal comfort and efficiency. For cooling-only needs, 16-20 SEER air conditioners handle the hot, humid summers effectively while managing energy costs.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does IPL offer solar rebates?</h3><p>IPL doesn't currently offer direct solar rebates but provides net metering at retail rates (12.3¢/kWh), allowing solar customers to earn full credit for excess energy production. IPL does offer rebates up to \$600 for high-efficiency HVAC equipment and \$50-100 for smart thermostats. The utility's time-of-use rates can benefit solar customers by providing higher compensation for daytime solar production.</p></div>

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much can I save with solar in Indianapolis?</h3><p>Indianapolis homeowners typically save \$700-1,500 annually with properly-sized solar systems. A 6kW system saves approximately \$886 per year at current IPL rates. Over 25 years, total savings often exceed \$22,000, while the system adds roughly \$15,000-20,000 in home value. Savings vary based on energy usage, roof orientation, and shading conditions.</p></div>

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">What size HVAC system do I need for a 1,920 sq ft Indianapolis home?</h3><p>The average 1,920 square foot Indianapolis home typically requires 2.5-4 ton cooling capacity and 60,000-100,000 BTU heating capacity, depending on insulation, windows, and layout.
