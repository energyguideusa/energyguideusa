const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Fort Wayne</h2>
<p>Fort Wayne, Indiana's cold climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, with winter temperatures regularly dropping below freezing and summer highs reaching the upper 80s. Home and business owners in Allen County's largest city need robust heating systems that can handle months of sub-zero weather while maintaining energy efficiency. With over 270,000 residents relying on dependable climate control, choosing the right HVAC system becomes crucial for both comfort and cost management throughout the year's extreme temperature swings.</p>

<p>Energy costs play a significant role in HVAC decisions for Fort Wayne residents, with Indiana Michigan Power providing electricity at 11.8¢/kWh. While this rate is relatively moderate compared to national averages, the extended heating season means Fort Wayne homeowners can expect higher energy bills from October through April. Modern high-efficiency systems become essential investments, as they can reduce heating costs by 20-40% compared to older equipment. The city's continental climate demands systems capable of efficient heating performance even when outdoor temperatures plummet to -10°F or lower.</p>
