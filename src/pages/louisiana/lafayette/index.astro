const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Lafayette, Louisiana</h2>
<p>Lafayette, Louisiana presents exceptional opportunities for solar energy adoption and efficient HVAC systems. With its Hot-Humid climate featuring abundant sunshine year-round, Lafayette receives approximately 2,800 hours of sunlight annually, making it ideal for solar panel installations. The city's electricity rate of 9.5¢/kWh through Lafayette Utilities System (LUS) provides a solid baseline for calculating solar savings, and while this rate is relatively moderate compared to national averages, the high cooling demands of Louisiana's climate create substantial energy bills that solar can significantly offset.</p>

<p>LUS serves Lafayette's 121,374 residents with reliable electrical service, and the utility has shown progressive support for renewable energy initiatives. The combination of Louisiana's net metering policies, federal tax incentives, and the region's excellent solar irradiance creates compelling economics for solar installations. For HVAC systems, Lafayette's Hot-Humid climate demands high-efficiency cooling systems that can handle both temperature and humidity loads effectively, making proper system sizing and efficiency ratings crucial for managing energy costs in the typical 1,820 square foot homes found throughout Lafayette Parish.</p>

<p>Solar installation costs in Lafayette typically range from \$3.00 to \$3.50 per watt before incentives, which aligns closely with Louisiana state averages. The annual savings calculations assume Lafayette's 9.5¢/kWh electricity rate and account for Louisiana's excellent solar production potential of approximately 1,400-1,500 kWh per kW installed annually. Most Lafayette homeowners with average energy usage find that a 6-8kW system adequately offsets their electricity bills, particularly when paired with energy-efficient HVAC systems. These payback periods typically range from 12-15 years, with systems providing 25+ years of energy production.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Lafayette</h2>
<p>Lafayette's Hot-Humid climate presents unique challenges that require carefully selected HVAC systems optimized for both temperature control and humidity management. The ideal HVAC system for Lafayette homes should feature a minimum SEER rating of 16-18, with higher ratings of 20+ providing better long-term savings given the extended cooling season that runs from April through October. Heat pumps are particularly effective in Lafayette's moderate winter climate, providing efficient heating when temperatures occasionally drop while delivering excellent cooling performance during the dominant warm months.</p>

<p>Variable-speed systems excel in Lafayette's climate by providing precise humidity control and consistent comfort while operating more efficiently than single-stage units. For the average 1,820 square foot Lafayette home, a properly sized 2.5 to 3-ton system typically provides adequate capacity. Dehumidification features are essential, as Lafayette's humidity levels often exceed 80% during summer months. Ductwork design and sealing become critical in the humid climate to prevent condensation issues and maintain efficiency. Smart thermostats paired with zoning systems can provide additional savings by optimizing comfort in occupied areas while reducing energy waste in unused spaces.</p>

<h2>Lafayette Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Lafayette residents have access to several attractive incentives for solar and HVAC upgrades. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on total system costs through 2032, stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the entire solar installation including equipment, labor, and permits. Louisiana offers additional state incentives through the Louisiana Solar Energy Systems Tax Credit, though homeowners should verify current program availability as state incentives have varied in recent years.</p>

<p>Lafayette Utilities System (LUS) has historically offered rebates for energy-efficient HVAC systems, with rebates typically ranging from \$200-600 for qualifying high-efficiency heat pumps and air conditioning systems. LUS also provides energy audits that can identify opportunities for efficiency improvements. The utility's net metering program allows solar customers to receive credit for excess electricity generated, though rates and terms should be confirmed directly with LUS as policies can evolve. Property tax exemptions for solar installations provide additional savings by preventing solar systems from increasing property tax assessments.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Lafayette</h2>
<p>Lafayette's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. The historic downtown area and older neighborhoods like Saint Streets and Freetown-Port Rico feature mature tree canopy that may require careful solar panel placement to optimize sun exposure, while the established homes often benefit from HVAC upgrades to improve efficiency and comfort. River Ranch, one of Lafayette's premier planned communities, features newer construction that's often solar-ready with optimal roof orientations and modern electrical systems that simplify installations.</p>

<p>Suburban neighborhoods like Broadmoor, Woodvale, and areas along Johnston Street offer excellent solar potential with spacious lots and fewer shading concerns. These areas, populated with homes from the 1970s-1990s, frequently benefit from both solar installations and HVAC upgrades as original systems reach replacement age. Newer developments in areas like Youngsville and Broussard (part of greater Lafayette) feature modern homes with energy-efficient construction that maximizes solar benefits and reduces overall HVAC loads. The proximity to University of Louisiana at Lafayette creates rental markets where energy efficiency improvements can provide attractive returns for property investors.</p>
