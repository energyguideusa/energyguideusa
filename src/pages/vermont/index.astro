<h2>Solar Panels in Vermont</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Vermont's solar resource potential is often underestimated due to its northern latitude, but the state actually receives excellent solar irradiance throughout the year. With 3.9 peak sun hours per day on average, Vermont ranks favorably compared to many other states, particularly when considering the high electricity rates that make solar savings more substantial. The state's solar irradiance varies seasonally, with summer months producing significantly more energy than winter months, but modern solar panel systems are designed to maximize production even in lower-light conditions.</p>

<p>A typical residential solar installation in Vermont can produce between 1,200 to 1,400 kWh per installed kW annually, depending on factors such as roof orientation, tilt angle, and shading. South-facing roofs with minimal shading provide optimal production, but east and west-facing installations can still achieve 80-90% of optimal production. Modern solar panels perform well in Vermont's climate, with cold temperatures actually improving panel efficiency. Snow can temporarily reduce production, but panels typically shed snow quickly due to their smooth surface and the heat they generate.</p>

<p>Vermont's net metering program allows solar panel owners to receive full retail credit for excess electricity they generate, making solar installations even more economically attractive. This means that excess summer production can offset winter consumption when solar production is lower. The state has committed to ambitious renewable energy goals, with plans to achieve 90% renewable electricity by 2050, creating a supportive policy environment for solar adoption.</p>
