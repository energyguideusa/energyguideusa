<p>HVAC system costs vary significantly based on home size, existing ductwork condition, and efficiency ratings selected. High-efficiency systems command premium prices but deliver substantial long-term savings through reduced energy consumption. Variable-speed systems provide superior comfort control and can reduce energy usage by 20-30% compared to single-speed units. Geothermal systems, while requiring higher upfront investment, offer the greatest long-term savings and can achieve 300-400% efficiency ratings year-round.</p>

<h2>Virginia Incentives & Rebates</h2>

<p>Virginia homeowners can take advantage of multiple incentive programs to reduce the cost of solar panel and HVAC system installations. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit for solar installations through 2032, then decreasing to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the total system cost including equipment, installation, permits, and sales tax, making it one of the most valuable incentives available.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth of Virginia offers a sales tax exemption for solar energy equipment, saving homeowners an additional 5.75% on system costs. This exemption applies to solar panels, inverters, mounting equipment, and battery storage systems when installed for residential use. Additionally, solar installations are exempt from local personal property taxes, ensuring that adding solar panels won't increase annual property tax obligations.</p>

<p>Dominion Energy provides several programs benefiting both solar and HVAC customers. The utility's net metering program credits solar customers at the full retail rate for excess electricity generated, with credits carrying forward month-to-month. For HVAC systems, Dominion offers rebates up to \$300 for high-efficiency heat pumps and up to \$600 for geothermal systems that meet specified efficiency requirements. The utility also provides rebates for smart thermostats, duct sealing, and other energy efficiency improvements.</p>
