<h2>Solar Panels in Kentucky</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Kentucky receives approximately 4.3 peak sun hours per day on average, which translates to solid solar energy production potential throughout the year. The state's solar irradiance levels are comparable to other successful solar markets in the region, with southern Kentucky receiving slightly higher solar radiation than northern areas. A typical residential solar installation in Kentucky can expect to generate between 1,200 to 1,400 kWh per year for each kilowatt of installed capacity, depending on system orientation, tilt angle, and local weather patterns.</p>

<p>The optimal solar panel orientation in Kentucky is south-facing with a tilt angle between 30-35 degrees, which maximizes year-round energy production. However, east and west-facing installations can still achieve 80-90% of optimal production, making solar viable for homes with various roof configurations. Kentucky's relatively mild weather conditions are actually beneficial for solar panel performance, as extreme heat can reduce panel efficiency. The state experiences fewer weather-related challenges compared to areas prone to hurricanes, hail storms, or heavy snow loads, contributing to lower maintenance costs and longer system lifespans.</p>

<p>Seasonal variations in solar production show peak generation during late spring and summer months, with reduced but still significant production during winter. This seasonal pattern aligns well with Kentucky's cooling demands, as solar systems generate the most electricity when air conditioning usage is highest. Net metering allows homeowners to bank excess summer production as credits to offset winter electricity consumption, creating year-round savings even when solar production is lower.</p>
