const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Aurora, Colorado</h2>
<p>Aurora, Colorado presents exceptional opportunities for both solar energy and efficient HVAC systems. With over 386,000 residents in Arapahoe County, Aurora enjoys approximately 300 days of sunshine annually, making it ideal for solar panel installations. The city's cold-dry climate means clear, sunny winter days that allow solar panels to operate efficiently even in cooler temperatures. With Xcel Energy's current electricity rate of 12.5¢/kWh, homeowners can see substantial savings by switching to solar power, especially given Colorado's strong net metering policies.</p>

<p>The cold-dry climate in Aurora creates unique HVAC considerations that complement solar installations perfectly. Winter temperatures can drop below freezing, while summers reach the 80s and 90s with low humidity. This climate pattern means heating costs typically exceed cooling costs, making energy-efficient heat pumps and high-efficiency furnaces essential. When paired with solar panels, Aurora homeowners can achieve energy independence while maintaining comfortable indoor temperatures year-round. The combination of abundant sunshine and clear seasonal heating/cooling needs makes Aurora an ideal location for integrated solar and HVAC solutions.</p>

<p>For Aurora's average home size of 1,880 square feet, a 6-8kW solar system typically provides optimal coverage. The annual savings calculations are based on Xcel Energy's current rate of 12.5¢/kWh and Aurora's average of 5.5 peak sun hours per day. Most Aurora homeowners see payback periods of 8-12 years, with systems lasting 25-30 years. Installation costs in Aurora are competitive due to the city's growing solar market and experienced local installers familiar with Xcel Energy's interconnection requirements.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora's cold-dry climate demands HVAC systems capable of efficient heating during harsh winters and moderate cooling during dry summers. High-efficiency furnaces with AFUE ratings of 90% or higher are recommended for primary heating, while heat pumps can provide excellent supplemental heating and cooling. For cooling systems, SEER ratings of 16-18 are ideal for Aurora's climate, as the dry air allows evaporative cooling to work effectively alongside traditional air conditioning.</p>

<p>Variable-speed systems perform exceptionally well in Aurora's climate, adjusting output to match seasonal demands while maintaining consistent comfort. Dual-fuel systems combining gas furnaces with electric heat pumps offer optimal efficiency, using the heat pump during milder weather and switching to gas heating when temperatures drop below 25°F. Proper insulation and ductwork are crucial in Aurora's climate, as temperature swings between seasons can be dramatic. Smart thermostats paired with zoning systems help Aurora homeowners maximize efficiency while maintaining comfort in their 1,880 square foot average homes.</p>

<h2>Aurora Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Aurora residents have access to multiple solar and HVAC incentives that significantly reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides 30% of total system costs as a tax credit through 2032, making it the most valuable incentive available. Colorado offers additional state tax credits up to \$5,000 for solar installations, while property tax exemptions ensure solar installations don't increase property tax assessments.</p>

<p>Xcel Energy provides net metering for Aurora customers, crediting excess solar production at retail rates. The utility also offers rebates for high-efficiency HVAC equipment, including up to \$600 for ENERGY STAR heat pumps and \$400 for high-efficiency air conditioners. Xcel's Home Energy Squad program provides free energy assessments and rebates for insulation and air sealing, which complement solar and HVAC upgrades. Aurora's participation in Colorado's C-PACE program allows commercial property owners to finance solar and HVAC improvements through property tax assessments, making upgrades accessible with no upfront costs.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora's diverse neighborhoods each present unique opportunities for solar and HVAC installations. The Southlands area, with its newer construction and larger lots, is ideal for ground-mounted solar systems and modern HVAC equipment. Homes in Southlands typically feature good south-facing roof exposure and sufficient electrical panel capacity for solar installations. The established neighborhoods around Aurora Hills Golf Course offer mature homes perfect for solar retrofits and HVAC upgrades, though older electrical systems may require updates.</p>

<p>The Stapleton area (now Central Park) features energy-efficient homes built with solar-ready infrastructure and high-efficiency HVAC systems as standard features. These neighborhoods often have HOA guidelines for solar installations that are generally solar-friendly. East Aurora's industrial areas offer excellent opportunities for commercial solar installations with large, unshaded roof spaces. The Murphy Creek and Tallyn's Reach neighborhoods feature newer homes with optimal roof angles for solar and modern HVAC systems that integrate well with solar power. Heritage Eagle Bend and Saddle Rock neighborhoods, with their custom homes and larger lots, provide excellent opportunities for comprehensive solar and geothermal HVAC systems.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Aurora</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in Aurora?</h3><p>Solar panel costs in Aurora range from \$15,000-\$35,000 before incentives, depending on system size. After the 30% federal tax credit and Colorado state incentives, typical costs range from \$10,500-\$24,500. For Aurora's average 1,880 sq ft home, a 6-8kW system costing \$12,600-\$19,600 after incentives is most common, providing annual savings of \$1,050-\$1,680 based on Xcel Energy's 12.5¢/kWh rate.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Best HVAC for Aurora climate?</h3><p>Aurora's cold-dry climate is best served by high-efficiency furnaces (90%+ AFUE) paired with 16-18 SEER air conditioning systems. Dual-fuel heat pumps work excellently, using electric heating in mild weather and gas heating below 25°F. Variable-speed systems and smart thermostats optimize performance across Aurora's wide temperature ranges, while proper insulation and ductwork are essential for the dramatic seasonal temperature swings.</p></div>
  
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Does Xcel Energy offer solar rebates?</h3><p>Xcel Energy doesn't offer direct solar rebates but provides excellent net metering for Aurora customers, crediting excess solar production at full retail rates of 12.5¢/kWh. Xcel does offer substantial HVAC rebates, including up to \$600 for ENERGY STAR heat pumps and \$400 for high-efficiency air conditioners. Their Home Energy Squad program provides free assessments and rebates for efficiency improvements that complement solar installations.</p></div>

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How long do solar panels last in Aurora's climate?</h3><p>Solar panels perform exceptionally well in Aurora's cold-dry climate, typically lasting 25-30 years with minimal degradation. The dry air reduces corrosion, while cold temperatures actually improve panel efficiency. Aurora's 300+ sunny days annually maximize production, and occasional snow naturally cleans panels while melting quickly due to panel heat and sun exposure.</p></div>

  <div><h3 class="font-bold">Can I run my HVAC system entirely on solar power?</h3><p>Yes, properly sized solar systems in Aurora can power HVAC systems year-round. A typical 1,880 sq ft Aurora home needs 8-10kW of solar to cover total energy usage including HVAC. Xcel Energy's net metering allows excess summer production to offset winter heating costs, making year-round solar-powered HVAC feasible in Aurora's climate.</p></div>
