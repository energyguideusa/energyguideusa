const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora, Colorado's cold-dry climate presents unique challenges for HVAC systems, requiring robust heating capabilities for harsh winters and efficient cooling for hot summer days. With a population of 386,261 residents in Arapahoe County, Aurora experiences temperature swings from sub-zero winter lows to 90°F+ summer highs, combined with low humidity levels year-round. This climate demands HVAC systems that can handle extreme temperature variations while managing the dry air that can cause comfort and health issues for residents.</p>

<p>Energy efficiency becomes crucial for Aurora homeowners, especially with Xcel Energy's electricity rate of 12.5¢/kWh. The cold-dry climate means heating costs typically dominate energy bills, accounting for 40-60% of annual utility expenses. Modern high-efficiency HVAC systems can significantly reduce these costs while providing better comfort control. Aurora's elevation of 5,471 feet also affects HVAC performance, requiring systems sized appropriately for the thinner air and potential altitude-related efficiency considerations.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Aurora Climate</h2>
<p>For Aurora's cold-dry climate, dual-fuel heat pump systems offer the best year-round efficiency, switching between electric heat pump operation in mild weather and gas furnace backup during extreme cold snaps below 25°F. Look for heat pumps with cold-climate ratings and variable-speed compressors that maintain efficiency in sub-freezing temperatures. A minimum 16 SEER rating is recommended, though 18+ SEER systems provide better long-term savings given Aurora's temperature extremes. Gas furnaces should have AFUE ratings of 90% or higher, with two-stage or modulating burners for consistent comfort. The dry climate also necessitates whole-home humidification systems to maintain 30-50% relative humidity, preventing respiratory issues and static electricity while protecting wood furniture and flooring from cracking.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora residents can access substantial HVAC rebates through multiple programs. Federal tax credits offer 30% of installation costs (up to \$2,000) for qualifying heat pumps through 2032, plus up to \$600 for high-efficiency air conditioners. Colorado's state rebate program provides additional incentives of \$200-800 for ENERGY STAR certified systems. Xcel Energy offers the most significant local rebates: \$400-1,200 for qualifying heat pumps, \$50-200 for high-efficiency air conditioners, and \$400-600 for furnaces with 92%+ AFUE ratings. Income-qualified customers can access enhanced rebates up to \$1,800 through Xcel's Energy Efficiency programs. Smart thermostats qualify for \$50-100 rebates, and whole-home air sealing can earn additional incentives of \$200-400 when combined with HVAC upgrades.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Aurora</h2>
<p>Selecting a qualified HVAC contractor in Aurora requires verifying Colorado state licensing and local Aurora business permits. Look for contractors with North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification and manufacturer certifications for the brands they install. Experience with high-altitude installations and cold-climate systems is crucial, as Aurora's 5,471-foot elevation affects equipment performance. Request detailed Manual J load calculations to ensure proper system sizing for your specific home. Quality contractors provide comprehensive warranties (10+ years on equipment, 2+ years on labor) and offer 24/7 emergency service during Aurora's harsh winter months. Check Better Business Bureau ratings and Google reviews, specifically looking for feedback about warranty service and system performance during extreme weather events. Obtain multiple detailed quotes that include equipment specifications, installation scope, permit costs, and post-installation commissioning procedures.</p>
