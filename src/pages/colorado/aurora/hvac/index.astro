const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora, Colorado's population of 386,261 residents in Arapahoe County faces unique HVAC challenges due to the region's cold-dry climate. With winter temperatures often dropping below freezing and low humidity year-round, Aurora homeowners need robust heating systems that can handle temperature swings from -10°F in January to 90°F+ in summer. The dry air also means less strain on cooling systems during summer months, but heating costs dominate utility bills from October through April.</p>

<p>With Xcel Energy serving Aurora at 12.5¢/kWh, residents pay slightly above the national average for electricity, making energy-efficient HVAC systems crucial for controlling costs. The cold-dry climate means heating accounts for approximately 60% of annual energy usage, while cooling represents only 15-20%. This makes high-efficiency furnaces and heat pumps particularly valuable investments, as even small efficiency improvements can yield significant savings over Aurora's extended heating season.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Aurora Climate</h2>
<p>Aurora's cold-dry climate requires careful system selection to maximize comfort and efficiency. For cooling, 16-18 SEER air conditioners perform exceptionally well due to low humidity levels, which make moderate temperatures feel comfortable. However, heating is the primary concern. High-efficiency gas furnaces (90+ AFUE) remain popular, but cold-climate heat pumps are increasingly viable. Modern heat pumps can operate effectively down to -15°F, covering most of Aurora's winter conditions. For optimal performance, look for heat pumps with variable-speed compressors and backup heating elements. Dual-fuel systems combining heat pumps with gas furnaces offer the best of both worlds, using efficient heat pump operation above 25°F and switching to gas during extreme cold snaps.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Aurora</h2>
<p>Aurora residents have access to multiple rebate programs that significantly reduce HVAC upgrade costs. Federal tax credits provide 30% of installation costs (up to \$2,000) for qualifying heat pumps through 2032, plus \$150-300 for high-efficiency air conditioners. Colorado's state programs offer additional rebates through Xcel Energy, including \$400-800 for ENERGY STAR heat pumps, \$50-200 for efficient air conditioners, and \$300-600 for smart thermostats. Xcel Energy also provides \$200 rebates for furnaces rated 95+ AFUE and up to \$1,000 for qualifying heat pump water heaters. Income-qualified customers can access enhanced rebates through Xcel's Energy Savings for Income Qualified Customers program, potentially covering 50-100% of upgrade costs. The Colorado New Energy Improvement District (C-PACE) also offers financing for commercial HVAC upgrades with favorable terms.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Aurora</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in Aurora requires attention to local climate expertise and proper credentials. Ensure contractors hold valid Colorado HVAC licenses and EPA certifications for refrigerant handling. Look for contractors experienced with Aurora's specific challenges, including altitude effects on equipment performance and extreme temperature variations. Quality contractors should provide detailed load calculations using Manual J methodology, offer multiple equipment options with honest efficiency comparisons, and guarantee proper installation with commissioning. Verify insurance coverage, check Better Business Bureau ratings, and request local references from recent Aurora installations. Emergency service availability is crucial given Aurora's sudden weather changes. Top contractors typically offer 24/7 emergency service, extended warranties beyond manufacturer coverage, and annual maintenance programs. Avoid contractors who quote without home inspections, push single brands exclusively, or request full payment upfront. Get written estimates from at least three licensed contractors, comparing equipment specifications, warranty terms, and total project costs.</p>
