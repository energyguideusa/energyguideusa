const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Pocatello, Idaho</h2>
<p>Pocatello, Idaho presents an excellent opportunity for homeowners to invest in solar panels and efficient HVAC systems. Despite the cold climate in Bannock County, Pocatello receives substantial sunlight throughout the year, with over 200 sunny days annually. The city's relatively low electricity rate of 9.9¢/kWh from Idaho Power may seem affordable, but with the average 1,750 square foot home requiring significant heating during harsh winters, energy costs can accumulate quickly. Solar panels can offset these expenses while providing long-term energy independence.</p>

<p>The combination of federal tax incentives, Idaho's net metering policies through Idaho Power, and the increasing efficiency of cold-weather solar technology makes Pocatello an ideal location for solar adoption. Idaho Power's net metering program allows homeowners to sell excess solar energy back to the grid at retail rates, maximizing savings. Additionally, modern HVAC systems designed for cold climates can work synergistically with solar installations, using clean energy to power heat pumps and furnaces that keep Pocatello's 56,320 residents comfortable year-round.</p>

<p>Solar installation costs in Pocatello typically range from \$3.10 to \$3.50 per watt before incentives. These prices reflect the competitive Idaho solar market and include high-quality panels, inverters, mounting systems, and professional installation. The payback period for most Pocatello homeowners ranges from 13-16 years, with systems lasting 25-30 years. Given Idaho Power's stable rate structure and the reliability of solar technology, homeowners can expect significant long-term savings after the initial investment period.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Pocatello</h2>
<p>Pocatello's cold climate demands robust HVAC systems capable of handling winter temperatures that frequently drop below freezing. For this climate zone, homeowners should prioritize high-efficiency furnaces with AFUE ratings of 90% or higher, or consider cold-climate heat pumps with HSPF ratings of 9.0 or above. Natural gas furnaces remain popular in Pocatello due to abundant local gas supplies, but electric heat pumps paired with solar panels offer an increasingly attractive alternative for environmentally conscious homeowners.</p>

<p>For cooling needs during Pocatello's mild summers, air conditioning systems with SEER ratings of 14-16 provide adequate efficiency without over-investing in cooling capacity that won't be frequently used. Ductless mini-split systems work exceptionally well in Pocatello's climate, offering zone control for the average 1,750 square foot home while providing both heating and cooling capabilities. These systems integrate seamlessly with solar installations, allowing homeowners to power their HVAC needs with clean energy throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Pocatello Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Pocatello residents have access to several attractive incentives for solar and HVAC upgrades. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% tax credit for solar installations through 2032, significantly reducing upfront costs. This credit applies to the entire solar system cost, including equipment, labor, and permits. For a typical \$20,000 solar installation, homeowners can claim \$6,000 in federal tax credits.</p>

<p>Idaho Power offers net metering for solar customers, crediting excess generation at retail rates and allowing unused credits to roll over monthly. While Idaho doesn't currently offer state-specific solar rebates, the state's tax-friendly environment means no additional state taxes on solar installations. For HVAC upgrades, federal tax credits up to \$2,000 are available for high-efficiency heat pumps, while additional rebates may be available through Idaho Power's energy efficiency programs for qualifying equipment upgrades.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Pocatello</h2>
<p>Pocatello's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. The historic Old Town area features charming older homes that may require electrical upgrades to accommodate solar systems, but these properties often have excellent south-facing roof orientations. Highland and Alameda neighborhoods contain many mid-century homes with simple rooflines ideal for solar panel placement and sufficient space for modern HVAC equipment.</p>

<p>Newer developments like Fairway Estates and areas near Portneuf Medical Center feature contemporary homes often pre-wired for modern electrical demands and built with better insulation standards. These neighborhoods typically see faster solar installation timelines and may require smaller HVAC systems due to improved building efficiency. Rural areas surrounding Pocatello offer abundant roof space and minimal shading concerns, making them excellent candidates for larger solar arrays, though they may require upgraded electrical service to handle substantial solar installations.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Pocatello</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div><h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in Pocatello?</h3><p>Solar panels in Pocatello typically cost between \$15,500-\$31,000 before incentives, depending on system size.
