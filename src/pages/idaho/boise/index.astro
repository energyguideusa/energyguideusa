const content = `<h2>Solar & HVAC in Boise, Idaho</h2>
<p>Boise, Idaho presents exceptional opportunities for both solar energy and efficient HVAC systems, making it an ideal location for homeowners looking to reduce energy costs and environmental impact. With Ada County's cold-dry climate featuring over 210 sunny days annually and minimal humidity, solar panels operate at peak efficiency while HVAC systems face less strain from moisture-related issues. The region's elevation of 2,730 feet provides cooler temperatures that enhance solar panel performance, as photovoltaic systems generate more electricity in cooler conditions despite abundant sunshine.</p>

<p>Idaho Power's current residential electricity rate of 10.4¢/kWh, combined with Boise's growing population of 235,684 residents, creates a compelling case for solar adoption and energy-efficient heating and cooling solutions. The utility's net metering program allows homeowners to sell excess solar power back to the grid, while the cold-dry climate means HVAC systems primarily focus on heating during harsh winters and efficient cooling during hot, dry summers. This climate pattern, with winter lows averaging 23°F and summer highs reaching 89°F, makes proper system sizing and efficiency ratings crucial for optimal performance and cost savings.</p>

<p>For Boise's average home size of 1,920 square feet, a 6-8kW solar system typically provides optimal coverage, generating approximately 7,500-10,000 kWh annually. The payback period ranges from 12-16 years, factoring in Idaho Power's 10.4¢/kWh rate and available incentives. Local installation costs average \$3.00-\$3.50 per watt, slightly below the national average due to Idaho's competitive solar market and lower permitting costs in Ada County.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems for Boise</h2>
<p>Boise's cold-dry climate demands HVAC systems capable of handling temperature extremes while managing low humidity levels efficiently. Heat pumps with backup electric or gas heating perform exceptionally well, providing efficient cooling during hot summers and adequate heating for mild winter days. For optimal performance, systems should feature SEER ratings of 16-18 for cooling efficiency and HSPF ratings of 9.0 or higher for heat pump heating efficiency.</p>

<p>Gas furnaces remain popular due to Idaho's relatively low natural gas costs, with AFUE ratings of 90% or higher recommended for maximum efficiency during Boise's cold winters. Variable-speed blower motors help maintain consistent temperatures and improve indoor air quality by better managing the dry climate conditions. Whole-house humidifiers are essential additions, as Boise's average humidity levels drop below 30% during winter months, causing comfort issues and potential health concerns.</p>

<p>For the typical 1,920 square foot Boise home, a 2.5-3 ton cooling capacity and 60,000-80,000 BTU heating capacity provide appropriate sizing. Ductless mini-split systems work well for home additions or specific zones, while traditional ducted systems remain ideal for whole-house comfort. Smart thermostats with humidity control features help optimize both energy usage and indoor comfort levels throughout Boise's varied seasonal conditions.</p>

<h2>Boise Energy Incentives</h2>
<p>Boise residents benefit from multiple layers of solar and energy efficiency incentives, starting with the federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) providing 30% of total system costs through 2032. This credit applies to solar panels, inverters, installation labor, and associated equipment, potentially saving homeowners \$5,000-\$10,000 on typical residential installations.</p>

<p>Idaho offers additional state incentives including a deduction for solar installations from property taxes, meaning increased home value from solar systems won't increase property tax assessments. The Idaho Power Customer Energy Efficiency Program provides rebates up to \$800 for high-efficiency heat pumps and up to \$600 for ENERGY STAR certified furnaces. Smart thermostat rebates of \$75-\$100 are available for qualifying programmable models.</p>

<p>Local Ada County programs occasionally offer additional weatherization assistance and energy audits for qualifying households. Idaho Power's Schedule 84 net metering program credits solar customers at full retail rate for excess generation, maximizing the value of solar production during peak daylight hours when panels generate more electricity than homes consume.</p>

<h2>Neighborhoods in Boise</h2>
<p>Boise's diverse neighborhoods each present unique considerations for solar and HVAC installations. The North End's historic homes from the early 1900s often require electrical upgrades and custom HVAC solutions to accommodate modern efficiency standards while preserving architectural integrity. Tree-lined streets may create shading challenges for solar installations, requiring careful panel placement and potential tree trimming considerations.</p>

<p>Southeast Boise's newer developments in areas like Barber Station and Southeast Ada County feature homes built with modern building codes, making solar and HVAC upgrades more straightforward. These neighborhoods typically have optimal roof orientations and minimal shading, ideal for solar installations. The Bench area's elevated position provides excellent solar exposure but may experience stronger winds requiring secure panel mounting systems.</p>

<p>Eagle and Meridian's suburban developments often feature larger homes exceeding 2,500 square feet, necessitating larger solar systems (8-10kW) and zoned HVAC systems for optimal comfort and efficiency. West Boise's established neighborhoods balance accessibility with mature landscaping that may affect solar panel placement but provides natural cooling benefits during summer months.</p>

<h2>FAQs for Boise</h2>
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div>
    <h3 class="font-bold">How much do solar panels cost in Boise?</h3>
    <p>Solar panel installations in Boise typically cost \$15,000-\$35,000 before incentives, depending on system size. After the 30% federal tax credit, costs range from \$10,500-\$24,500. For a typical 1,920 sq ft Boise home, expect to invest \$18,000-\$28,000 for a 6-8kW system, with annual savings of \$780-\$1,200 based on Idaho Power's 10.4¢/kWh rate.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 class="font-bold">What's the best HVAC system for Boise's cold-dry climate?</h3>
    <p>Heat pumps with backup heating perform excellently in Boise's climate, providing efficient cooling and heating for most of the year. Look for SEER 16-18 cooling efficiency and HSPF 9.0+ heating efficiency. Gas furnaces with 90%+ AFUE ratings are also popular due to low natural gas costs. Always include whole-house humidification to combat the dry climate, especially during winter months when humidity drops below 30%.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 class="font-bold">Does Idaho Power offer solar rebates?</h3>
    <p>Idaho Power doesn't offer direct solar rebates, but they provide excellent net metering through Schedule 84, crediting excess solar production at full retail rates. They do offer rebates up to \$800 for high-efficiency heat pumps and \$600 for ENERGY STAR furnaces. Combined with the federal 30% tax credit and Idaho's property tax exemption for solar installations, Boise residents still enjoy substantial solar incentives.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 class="font-bold">How many solar panels do I need for a 1,920 sq ft home in Boise?</h3>
    <p>A typical 1,920 sq ft Boise home uses 8,000-12,000 kWh annually, requiring 18-24 solar panels (300-350 watts each) for a 6-8kW system. Boise's excellent solar irradiance of 4.5-5.5 peak sun hours daily means smaller systems can offset significant electricity usage. Factors like home orientation, roof condition, and energy consumption patterns determine exact panel requirements.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 class="font-bold">What SEER rating should I choose for Boise?</h3>
    <p>For Boise's climate, SEER 16-18 provides optimal efficiency without over-investing in cooling capacity rarely needed. The dry climate means air conditioners work more efficiently than in humid regions, so moderate SEER ratings perform well. Focus equally on heating efficiency (HSPF 9.0+ for heat pumps, AFUE 90%+ for furnaces) since heating demands exceed cooling in Boise's cold-dry climate.</p>
