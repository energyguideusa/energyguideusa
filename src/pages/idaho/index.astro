const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Idaho presents exceptional opportunities for both solar panel installations and efficient HVAC systems, making it one of the most attractive states in the Pacific Northwest for renewable energy investments. With an impressive average of 4.9 peak sun hours per day, Idaho receives more solar radiation than many other northern states, creating ideal conditions for solar energy production. The state's high elevation, clear skies, and relatively dry climate contribute to optimal solar panel performance throughout much of the year.</p>

<p>The economic case for solar and HVAC upgrades in Idaho is particularly compelling due to the state's moderate electricity rates of approximately 10.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, primarily supplied by Idaho Power Company, which serves the majority of the state's residents and businesses. While these rates are reasonable compared to national averages, the long-term savings potential through solar installations and energy-efficient HVAC systems remains substantial. Idaho's commitment to renewable energy, combined with favorable state policies and federal incentives, creates an environment where homeowners and businesses can achieve significant returns on their clean energy investments while reducing their environmental footprint.</p>

<p>The state's diverse geography, ranging from the northern panhandle's humid continental climate to the southern regions' semi-arid conditions, requires tailored approaches to both solar installations and HVAC systems. Idaho's cold winters and warm summers demand efficient heating and cooling solutions, while the abundant sunshine provides ample opportunity for solar energy generation to offset these energy needs throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in Idaho</h2>
<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Idaho's solar resource potential is exceptional for a northern state, with annual solar irradiance levels ranging from 4.5 to 5.5 kWh/m²/day across different regions. The southern portions of the state, including areas around Boise, Twin Falls, and Pocatello, receive the highest levels of solar radiation, making them particularly attractive for solar installations. Northern Idaho, while receiving slightly less solar radiation, still maintains excellent solar potential with consistent sunshine throughout the growing season.</p>

<p>A typical residential solar installation in Idaho can expect to generate between 1,200 to 1,400 kilowatt-hours per installed kilowatt annually, depending on location, panel orientation, and system design. This production level places Idaho among the top tier of northern states for solar energy generation. The state's high altitude and clear atmospheric conditions contribute to enhanced solar panel efficiency, as panels operate more effectively in cooler temperatures despite popular misconceptions about needing hot weather for solar production.</p>

<p>Seasonal variations in Idaho show peak solar production during the long summer days of June and July, when daylight extends well into the evening hours. Winter production, while reduced, remains significant due to snow's reflective properties and the state's abundant winter sunshine. Modern solar panels continue to generate electricity even in cold weather, and Idaho's dry snow typically slides off panels naturally, minimizing maintenance requirements during winter months.</p>
