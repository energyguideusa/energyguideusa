const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Idaho presents exceptional opportunities for both solar panel installations and efficient HVAC systems, making it an ideal state for homeowners looking to reduce energy costs and environmental impact. With an average of 4.9 peak sun hours per day and abundant sunshine throughout the year, Idaho ranks among the top western states for solar energy production. The state's relatively low electricity rates of 10.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, primarily served by Idaho Power Company, create significant potential for solar savings when combined with the state's excellent solar resource.</p>

<p>Idaho's diverse climate, ranging from moderate temperatures in the Boise Valley to colder mountain regions, creates unique HVAC needs that can be effectively addressed with modern, efficient systems. The state experiences hot, dry summers and cold winters, requiring both heating and cooling systems that can handle temperature swings while maintaining energy efficiency. When combined with solar panels, high-efficiency HVAC systems can dramatically reduce energy costs, with many homeowners achieving 80-90% reductions in their electricity bills.</p>

<p>The combination of federal tax incentives, Idaho's property tax exemption for solar installations, and Idaho Power's net metering program creates a favorable financial environment for renewable energy investments. Most Idaho homeowners see payback periods of 6-8 years for solar installations, followed by decades of free electricity production and substantial HVAC energy savings.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in Idaho</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>Idaho's solar irradiance levels range from 4.5 to 5.5 peak sun hours daily depending on location, with southern Idaho receiving the highest solar radiation. The state benefits from over 200 sunny days per year, with summer months providing peak production from May through September. Boise and the Treasure Valley receive approximately 5.2 peak sun hours daily, while northern regions like Coeur d'Alene average around 4.6 hours. These levels are comparable to solar-friendly states like Colorado and significantly higher than many East Coast locations.</p>

<p>Seasonal variations in Idaho create interesting production patterns, with summer months generating 40-50% more electricity than winter months. However, the state's cold, clear winter days often provide excellent solar conditions, and snow reflection can actually boost panel performance. A typical 6kW residential solar system in Idaho produces between 7,500-9,000 kWh annually, easily covering the average Idaho home's electricity consumption of 12,000-13,000 kWh when properly sized.</p>

<p>Idaho's high elevation and dry climate provide ideal conditions for solar panel efficiency. The cooler temperatures at higher elevations actually improve panel performance, as photovoltaic cells operate more efficiently in moderate temperatures. Combined with minimal air pollution and low humidity, Idaho's environmental conditions help solar panels maintain peak performance throughout their 25-30 year lifespan.</p>

<p>Solar installation costs in Idaho average \$2.80-\$3.20 per watt before incentives, slightly below the national average due to competitive local markets and lower labor costs. The federal 30% tax credit significantly reduces upfront costs, and Idaho's property tax exemption for solar installations provides ongoing savings. Most installations include premium tier-1 panels, string or power optimizers, and comprehensive monitoring systems with 20-25 year warranties.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems in Idaho</h2>

<h3>Climate Considerations</h3>
<p>Idaho's continental climate creates significant heating and cooling demands, with winter temperatures often dropping below freezing and summer temperatures reaching 90-100°F in many areas. Heating typically represents 40-60% of annual energy usage, while cooling accounts for 15-25%, making efficient systems crucial for energy savings. The state's low humidity levels mean evaporative cooling can be effective in some regions, while heat pumps are increasingly popular for their dual heating and cooling efficiency.</p>

<p>For cooling systems, SEER ratings of 16-18 are recommended for most Idaho locations, balancing efficiency with cost-effectiveness. In northern Idaho's cooler climate, SEER 14-16 systems may be sufficient, while southern regions benefit from higher efficiency units. For heating, HSPF ratings of 9.0 or higher are recommended for heat pumps, while gas furnaces should have AFUE ratings of 90% or higher to maximize efficiency during Idaho's cold winters.</p>

<p>Dual-fuel systems combining heat pumps with gas furnace backup are particularly effective in Idaho, using the heat pump for moderate temperatures and switching to gas when outdoor temperatures drop below 25-30°F. This approach maximizes efficiency across Idaho's wide temperature range while ensuring reliable heating during extreme cold snaps that can last several days or weeks.</p>

<h2>Idaho Incentives & Rebates</h2>
<p>Idaho offers several attractive incentives for solar and HVAC installations, making these investments highly cost-effective for homeowners. The primary incentives include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Federal Solar Tax Credit (30%):</strong> The federal government provides a 30% tax credit for solar panel installations through 2032, then decreasing to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit applies to the total system cost including equipment, installation, and permitting. For a \$20,000 solar system, homeowners receive a \$6,000 tax credit, directly reducing their federal tax liability.</li>

<li><strong>Idaho Property Tax Exemption:</strong> Idaho exempts solar energy systems from property tax assessments, meaning the added value from solar panels won't increase property taxes. This exemption applies to both residential and commercial installations and continues for the life of the system, providing ongoing savings.</li>

<li><strong>Idaho Power Net Metering:</strong> Idaho Power customers with solar systems up to 25kW can participate in net metering, receiving retail rate credits for excess electricity sent to the grid. These credits roll over month-to-month and are paid out annually at avoided cost rates if unused.</li>

<li><strong>Idaho Power Energy Efficiency Programs:</strong> Idaho Power offers rebates up to \$1,000 for high-efficiency heat pumps, \$500 for programmable thermostats, and various other HVAC efficiency upgrades. The utility also provides energy audits and financing options for qualified improvements.</li>

<li><strong>USDA Rural Development Grants:</strong> Rural Idaho properties may qualify for USDA grants covering up to 25% of renewable energy system costs, combined with low-interest loans. This program can be stacked with other incentives for maximum savings.</li>
</ul>

<p>To maximize incentives, homeowners should work with certified installers familiar with local programs and ensure all documentation is properly submitted. The combination of federal, state, and utility incentives can reduce total system costs by 40-50%, significantly improving payback periods and long-term returns.</p>
