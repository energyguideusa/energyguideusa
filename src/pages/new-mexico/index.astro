const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>New Mexico stands as one of the premier locations in the United States for solar energy adoption and HVAC system optimization. With an impressive average of 5.8 sun hours per day and over 310 sunny days annually, the Land of Enchantment offers exceptional solar irradiance levels that consistently rank among the top five states nationwide. The combination of high altitude, low humidity, and abundant sunshine creates ideal conditions for photovoltaic systems to operate at peak efficiency throughout the year.</p>

<p>The state's energy landscape is equally compelling from an economic standpoint. With average electricity rates of 12.8¢ per kilowatt-hour served primarily by Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), residents face moderately priced electricity that makes solar investment particularly attractive. New Mexico's diverse climate zones, ranging from high desert to mountainous regions, create unique opportunities for both heating and cooling system optimization, with many areas requiring substantial heating in winter and moderate cooling in summer.</p>

<p>Energy savings potential in New Mexico is substantial, with typical residential solar installations generating 25-35% more electricity per installed watt compared to the national average. The state's commitment to renewable energy, demonstrated through aggressive clean energy standards requiring utilities to source 50% of their electricity from renewable sources by 2030, creates a supportive environment for homeowners investing in solar and energy-efficient HVAC systems. Combined with excellent federal and state incentive programs, New Mexico homeowners can achieve payback periods of 6-8 years on solar installations while significantly reducing their carbon footprint.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in New Mexico</h2>

<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>New Mexico's solar resource is exceptional, with the state receiving an average of 5.8 peak sun hours daily and annual solar irradiance levels ranging from 6.0 to 7.5 kWh/m²/day depending on location. The high desert climate provides consistent, intense solar radiation throughout the year, with minimal cloud cover and atmospheric interference. Southern regions, including Las Cruces and areas along the Mexican border, experience some of the highest irradiance levels in the continental United States, while northern mountain areas still maintain excellent solar potential.</p>

<p>Seasonal variations in New Mexico are favorable for solar production, with summer months delivering peak performance from May through September. During these months, well-positioned solar arrays can generate 1,200-1,400 kWh per installed kilowatt, while winter production typically ranges from 800-1,000 kWh per kilowatt. The state's high altitude contributes to increased solar panel efficiency due to cooler ambient temperatures and clearer atmospheric conditions. A typical 6kW residential system in New Mexico can produce 9,000-11,000 kWh annually, often exceeding utility bills for average households.</p>

<p>The dry climate also provides operational advantages, with minimal weather-related production interruptions and reduced maintenance requirements due to low precipitation and humidity levels. Snow events are generally brief and panels typically self-clear due to their angle and the intense solar radiation. These conditions result in capacity factors of 22-26%, significantly higher than the national average of 20%, making New Mexico an ideal location for maximizing return on solar investments.</p>

<h2>HVAC Systems in New Mexico</h2>

<h3>Climate Considerations</h3>
<p>New Mexico's diverse climate zones create unique HVAC requirements that vary significantly across the state. The high desert climate characteristic of much of New Mexico features hot, dry summers with temperatures reaching 90-100°F and cold winters with temperatures dropping to 20-30°F in many areas. This climate pattern requires HVAC systems capable of both efficient cooling and reliable heating, making heat pumps and dual-fuel systems particularly attractive options for many homeowners.</p>

<p>For cooling efficiency in New Mexico's arid climate, SEER ratings of 16-20 are recommended to balance energy efficiency with equipment costs. The dry climate allows evaporative cooling systems to be highly effective in many areas, particularly in regions below 4,000 feet elevation where humidity levels remain consistently low. However, higher elevation areas like Santa Fe and Taos require more traditional refrigerant-based cooling due to higher humidity levels and different temperature patterns.</p>

<p>Heating requirements vary dramatically by elevation and location, with northern and mountainous areas requiring robust heating systems capable of handling extended periods below freezing. Heat pump systems with auxiliary heating are increasingly popular due to their efficiency in moderate climates, while areas experiencing extended sub-freezing temperatures may benefit from dual-fuel systems combining heat pumps with gas furnaces. The state's excellent solar resource also makes solar-assisted heat pumps and radiant heating systems viable options for reducing heating costs.</p>

<h2>New Mexico Incentives & Rebates</h2>
<p>New Mexico offers a comprehensive array of incentives and rebates that make solar and energy-efficient HVAC investments highly attractive. The foundation of these incentives begins with the federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which provides a 30% tax credit for solar installations completed through 2032. This credit applies to the total system cost including equipment, installation, and related expenses, with no cap on the credit amount for residential installations.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Federal 30% Solar Tax Credit:</strong> Available for solar installations through 2032, stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. This credit can be carried forward if it exceeds tax liability in the installation year, and applies to battery storage systems when installed with solar.</li>
<li><strong>New Mexico Solar Tax Credit:</strong> The state offers an additional 10% tax credit for solar installations, capped at \$6,000 for residential systems. This credit can be combined with the federal credit for total savings of up to 40% of installation costs.</li>
<li><strong>PNM Solar Programs:</strong> Public Service Company of New Mexico offers net metering at retail rates, allowing customers to receive full credit for excess solar production. PNM also provides interconnection support and streamlined permitting processes for residential solar installations.</li>
<li><strong>Local Utility Rebates:</strong> Various municipal utilities throughout New Mexico offer additional rebates for solar and energy efficiency improvements. Albuquerque residents may qualify for additional rebates through the city's environmental programs.</li>
<li><strong>PACE Financing:</strong> Property Assessed Clean Energy financing is available in some New Mexico counties, allowing property owners to finance solar and energy efficiency improvements through property tax assessments with terms up to 20 years.</li>
</ul>

<p>To maximize incentives, homeowners should work with certified installers familiar with local requirements and timing considerations. Tax credits must be claimed in the year of installation, and proper documentation including manufacturer certifications and installation receipts are required. Many homeowners can achieve effective system costs of 50-60% of the gross installation price when combining federal, state, and local incentives.</p>
