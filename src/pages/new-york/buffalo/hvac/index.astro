const content = `<h2>HVAC Systems in Buffalo</h2>
<p>Buffalo's harsh winters and humid summers create unique HVAC challenges for the city's 278,349 residents. With temperatures regularly dropping below freezing from December through March and summer highs reaching the 80s, Erie County homeowners need robust heating systems that can handle extended cold periods while still providing efficient cooling. The city's proximity to Lake Erie adds moisture to the air, requiring HVAC systems that can effectively manage humidity year-round while maintaining consistent indoor comfort.</p>

<p>Energy efficiency is particularly crucial in Buffalo given National Grid's electricity rate of 16.8¢/kWh, which is higher than the national average. This makes selecting the right HVAC system a critical financial decision that impacts both comfort and long-term operating costs. Buffalo homeowners typically spend 40-50% more on heating than cooling due to the extended winter season, making high-efficiency heating solutions like heat pumps with backup systems or high-efficiency furnaces essential investments for managing energy costs effectively.</p>

<h2>Best HVAC Systems for Buffalo Climate</h2>
<p>For Buffalo's cold climate, dual-fuel heat pump systems with gas furnace backup are ideal, providing efficient heating down to 25°F before switching to gas. Look for heat pumps rated for cold climates with HSPF ratings of 9.0 or higher. For cooling, 16-18 SEER systems are optimal - higher SEER ratings provide diminishing returns given Buffalo's moderate summer cooling needs of only 60-80 days annually. Gas furnaces should have AFUE ratings of 90% or higher, while central air conditioning systems should include variable-speed blowers to manage the region's humidity effectively. Heating accounts for roughly 70% of annual HVAC energy use in Buffalo, making heating efficiency the primary consideration when selecting equipment.</p>

<h2>HVAC Rebates in Buffalo</h2>
<p>Buffalo residents can access multiple rebate programs to offset HVAC costs. Federal tax credits offer up to \$2,000 for qualifying heat pumps and up to \$600 for high-efficiency air conditioners installed through 2032. New York State's Clean Heat Program provides rebates up to \$4,000 for heat pump installations, with additional income-based incentives available. National Grid offers substantial rebates including \$500-1,200 for ENERGY STAR certified heat pumps, \$400-800 for high-efficiency central air systems, and up to \$1,000 for smart thermostats when bundled with system upgrades. The utility also provides 0% financing for qualifying HVAC upgrades, making energy-efficient systems more accessible to Erie County homeowners.</p>

<h2>Choosing an HVAC Contractor in Buffalo</h2>
<p>Selecting the right HVAC contractor in Buffalo requires verifying New York State licensing, insurance coverage, and Better Business Bureau ratings. Look for contractors with specific cold-climate experience who understand Lake Erie's impact on local humidity and can properly size systems for Buffalo's 6,600+ heating degree days. Quality contractors provide detailed load calculations, offer 5-10 year warranties on installations, and maintain 24/7 emergency service given Buffalo's harsh winters. Request references from recent customers and verify the contractor's experience with your specific system type, whether traditional furnace/AC combinations or newer heat pump technologies. Avoid door-to-door sales and always get multiple written estimates that include equipment specifications, labor costs, and warranty details.</p>
