const content = `<h2>Solar Panel Installation in Buffalo</h2>
<p>Buffalo's cold climate doesn't prevent solar panels from being an excellent investment for the city's 278,349 residents in Erie County. Despite winter snow and shorter daylight hours, modern solar panels actually perform more efficiently in cooler temperatures, making Buffalo's climate surprisingly favorable for solar energy production. With National Grid's electricity rates at 16.8¢/kWh—significantly higher than the national average—Buffalo homeowners can achieve substantial savings by switching to solar power.</p>

<p>The key to successful solar installation in Buffalo lies in proper system design that accounts for snow load requirements and optimal panel placement to maximize sun exposure during shorter winter days. Professional installers familiar with Buffalo's building codes and weather patterns will ensure your system includes adequate tilt angles for snow shedding and durable mounting systems that can withstand lake-effect snow conditions. National Grid's net metering program allows Buffalo residents to sell excess power back to the grid, making solar installations even more financially attractive in this high-rate utility territory.</p>

<h2>Solar Incentives in Buffalo</h2>
<p>Buffalo residents have access to multiple solar incentives that significantly reduce installation costs. The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 30% credit on the total system cost through 2032, then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. New York State offers additional incentives through the NY-Sun program, providing upfront rebates ranging from \$0.30 to \$0.40 per watt depending on system size and installer participation. National Grid customers in Buffalo can also benefit from the utility's Clean Energy Programs, which may provide additional rebates for energy-efficient upgrades. Combined with New York's property tax exemption for solar installations and the state's net metering policy, these incentives can reduce the total cost of going solar by 40-50% or more.</p>

<h2>Best Solar Companies in Buffalo</h2>
<p>When selecting a solar installer in Buffalo, prioritize companies with extensive experience in cold-climate installations and proper New York State licensing. Look for contractors who are NABCEP-certified, carry comprehensive insurance, and offer strong warranties on both equipment and workmanship—typically 25 years on panels and 10-12 years on inverters. The best Buffalo solar companies will provide detailed site assessments that account for local factors like snow load, prevailing winds from Lake Erie, and seasonal shading from mature trees. They should also be well-versed in local permitting requirements and have established relationships with National Grid for smooth interconnection processes. Request multiple quotes, check Better Business Bureau ratings, and ask for local references from installations completed at least two years ago to verify long-term performance.</p>

<h2>Solar ROI in Buffalo</h2>
<p>Buffalo's high electricity rates make solar an excellent investment with typical payback periods of 9-11 years. Based on National Grid's 16.8¢/kWh rate, a typical 6kW system generating 7,200 kWh annually will save approximately \$1,210 per year in electricity costs. After factoring in the 30% federal tax credit, the net investment of \$12,600 pays for itself in about 10.4 years. Over the 25-year system lifespan, total savings exceed \$30,000, representing a return on investment of over 250%. Even accounting for Buffalo's shorter winter days and occasional snow coverage, the city receives adequate sunlight for profitable solar production. With electricity rates likely to increase over time and solar equipment costs continuing to decline, Buffalo residents who install solar now can expect even better returns on their investment.</p>
