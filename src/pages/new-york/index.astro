const content = `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>New York presents exceptional opportunities for both solar energy and HVAC system upgrades, making it one of the most attractive states for homeowners looking to reduce energy costs and environmental impact. Despite common misconceptions about solar viability in northern climates, New York receives an average of 3.8 sun hours per day, which is sufficient for significant solar energy production. The state's high electricity rates, averaging 18.1¢ per kilowatt-hour, create substantial savings potential for solar adopters compared to the national average of approximately 13¢/kWh.</p>

<p>ConEd (Consolidated Edison) serves as the primary utility provider for New York City and Westchester County, while other regions are served by utilities like National Grid and NYSEG. These high electricity rates, combined with New York's progressive renewable energy policies and robust incentive programs, create a compelling financial case for solar installation. The state's ambitious climate goals, including a mandate for 70% renewable electricity by 2030, have resulted in generous rebate programs and streamlined permitting processes that benefit homeowners.</p>

<p>New York's diverse climate zones, from the moderate conditions of Long Island to the harsh winters of upstate regions, create varying HVAC needs across the state. Modern heat pump technology has become increasingly viable even in colder regions, while traditional heating and cooling systems remain essential for many areas. The combination of high energy costs and extreme seasonal temperature variations makes efficient HVAC systems particularly valuable investments for New York homeowners, often providing payback periods of 7-12 years through energy savings alone.</p>

<h2>Solar Panels in New York</h2>
<h3>Solar Resource and Production</h3>
<p>New York's solar resource potential is often underestimated due to its northern latitude, but the state actually provides excellent conditions for solar energy production. With an average of 3.8 peak sun hours per day, New York ranks in the middle tier of U.S. states for solar potential. The state's solar irradiance varies by region, with areas like Long Island and the Hudson Valley receiving slightly more sun than upstate regions, but even the northern counties maintain viable solar production levels.</p>

<p>A typical residential solar installation in New York can generate between 1,100 and 1,400 kilowatt-hours per year per installed kilowatt of capacity. This means a 6kW system can produce approximately 6,600-8,400 kWh annually, which covers 50-80% of an average household's electricity consumption. The state's net metering policies allow homeowners to receive full retail credit for excess solar production, making systems financially viable even when they don't meet 100% of energy needs.</p>

<p>Seasonal variation is significant in New York, with summer months producing 40-60% more solar energy than winter months. However, this seasonal pattern often aligns well with air conditioning demands, creating natural load matching during peak production periods. Snow coverage can temporarily reduce production in winter, but modern solar panels are designed to shed snow effectively, and the reflective properties of snow can actually boost production on clear winter days.</p>
